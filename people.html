            <h4> <a href="people/cweicker.html">Claudia T. Weicker</a></h4>
            <p>Claudia Testa Weicker was born to second-generation Italian parents and was raised in Connecticut. From an early age, politics was a part of her home life. She recalls:</p>
        <p>“One of the earliest memories I have was a political conversation between my mother and father about the 1952 Presidential election…he was for Stevenson and my mother was for Eisenhower. In our home, dinner time was when these conversations took place and they always seemed to have time for our opinions as we were growing up.” </p>
            <p>Engagement in political conversation and exposure to politics fueled her interest in active participation. Her first involvement in politics was during the 1960 Presidential election, in which she volunteered at the Kennedy headquarters. There she worked for the Kennedy campaign by stuffing envelopes, attending phone banks, and passing out campaign literature. Throughout high school and college Claudia continued to work in local elections and offer her services whenever possible. She was, and remains, a Democrat. <a href="people/cweicker.html" class="more-link">More</a></p>

She left the PMI program to serve as a legislative assistant to Lowell Weicker on transportation issues.
