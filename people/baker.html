      <h3>Geoffrey Baker</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Geoffrey Baker worked in several different capacities for Senator Weicker from 1972 to 1982. Born in New York City, Baker grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. As a boy he attended the Country Day School, prep school, then Stanford University. Baker earned his law degree from Georgetown University while working as a Committee aide. Knowing he wanted to spend time on the Hill, Baker became involved with Weicker, his congressional representative, through summer internships.</p>
          <p>Starting in 1970, Baker worked as a summer intern for then Representative Weicker in Washington, D.C. After two summers and a year of graduate school, Baker joined the staff as a legislative assistant. From 1972–74, he worked as a legislative aide. From 1975–77, he moved to the Senate Commerce Committee, but still remained loyal to the Weicker team. In the late 1970s, Baker returned to the Weicker staff as a legislative director, managing the staff and daily operations of Weicker’s office. As a staffer, Baker primarily worked on surface transportation issues as well as financial issues and appropriations. </p>
          <p>During his time on the Commerce Committee, Baker saw legislation on Amtrak, the New Haven Railroad, and Conrail through the Senate. Additionally, he assisted with the Animal Welfare Act Amendments of 1976, which tightened legislation of illegal and inhumane animal transportation and added an amendment outlawing animal fighting and specifically dog fighting. Weicker and Baker worked together on the federal level as a result of broad interpretation of federal authority over interstate commerce. In addition to working on Commerce, Baker worked on Science and Transportation, working closely with fellow staffer Mary McAuliffe. Baker had several other areas of focus as well, including the Natural Gas Emergency Act of 1975, a reaction to an oil shortage during the Ford Administration in the aftermath of Nixon’s resignation. Baker increasingly worked on oceans conservation legislation as well, which became a central part of Weicker’s legislative agenda.</p>
          <p>During his time, Baker worked closely with Weicker staffers such as Bob Wicklund, Bob Dotchin, Mary McAuliffe, and Senator Pearson. Geoffrey Baker stayed with Weicker’s staff until 1982. Today Baker is active in venture capital and private equity investing.</p>
