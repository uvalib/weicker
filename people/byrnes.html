      <h3>Maureen Byrnes</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Maureen Byrnes worked as a congressional aide for Senator Weicker through the 1980s. Byrnes received her undergraduate degree in English from Le Moyne College in New York and a master’s in Public Administration at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. In 1981, she became executive director of a crisis intervention center called Hassle House in Durham. Reagan budget cuts in the early 80s, however, eliminated funding for the center and sent Byrnes to Washington, D.C., for the Presidential Management Internship program. As a PMI she worked for the Justice Department on various related issues, and later would work for Weicker’s office on loan from the Justice Department. She left the PMI program to serve as a legislative assistant to Lowell Weicker on transportation issues. While in this role from 1983-85, Byrnes dealt directly with Amtrak budget issues and staffed Senator Weicker on hearings that included then Secretary of Transportation, Elizabeth Dole. </p>
          <p>From 1983-85, Byrnes took part in a nationwide tour of state mental health institutions, investigating and reporting on cases of abuse and neglect. She and other staffers, including Steven Snider and Terry Muilenburg, surveyed nearly 30 different mental health facilities and afterwards presented their staff report to Weicker. Their report revealed the extent of mistreatment and abuse, provided suggestions on improving the system, and would culminate in the passage of (S. 974) The Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Persons Act and (S. 415) The Handicapped Children’s Protection Act into law.</p>
          <p>Byrnes also worked closely with Senator Weicker on National Institutes for Health (NIH) issues and on vaccine legislation and functioned as one of the staff liaisons with other members, such as cooperating with Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) on bills that dealt with health care and education for the mentally handicapped. Byrnes served as Weicker’s staff director of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies from 1986-88. She prepared materials for the hearings on a wide range of issues, including funding for schizophrenia research in 1986-87, and worked with the Bioethics Advisory Board during the late 1980s. Byrnes also helped to set Weicker’s overall legislative, political, and fundraising agenda with aide Kim Elliott and other major staffers. </p>
          <p>As Staff Director of the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, Byrnes worked primarily on health care issues, including HIV/AIDS legislation. In September of 1985, Byrnes began investigating allegations of internal divisions in the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The allegations centered on suppression of research and sabotage of experiments, as well as arguments concerning the power and competency of AIDS research leadership. In addition, she advised Weicker on National Institutes of Health research funding for HIV/AIDS, ensuring access to needed services for people living with HIV/AIDS, and prepared Weicker in his opposition to Senator Jesse Helms’ outrage with the “homosexual agenda” and efforts to impose restrictions on HIV/AIDS prevention and education efforts. Byrnes also assisted Weicker in his pursuit of funding for the HIV/AIDS treatment, AZT, Weicker’s partnership with Sen. Edward Kennedy on S. 1220, and Weicker’s advocacy for HIV/AIDS education and prevention.</p>
          <p>After Weicker lost the 1988 election, Maureen Byrnes remained on the Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee, but left shortly thereafter to head up an AIDS coalition, serving as the Executive Director of the National Commission on AIDS. </p>
          <p>Byrnes went on to serve as the Director of the Health and Human Services program at The Pew Charitable Trusts. She was involved with the Human Rights First organization for a brief time, and is currently a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and works as an independent consultant with a focus on public health and human rights issues.</p>
