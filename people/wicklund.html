      <h3>Robert I. Wicklund</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Robert I. Wicklund worked as a legislative aide for with Senator Lowell Weicker on oceans and environmental issues, as well as working on policy related to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).<br>
          A native of Highlands, New Jersey, Wicklund had no formal education beyond secondary school. He worked in a government marine lab where he was taken under the wing of the director, and after eight years at the lab, he had become the scientific dive officer and had already published over 20 papers. </p>
          <p>From there he went on to work as the director of the Hydro-Lab Undersea Research Program in an underwater laboratory (a Hydro-lab), studying animal, plant, oceanographic, and ecological ocean life. As a big supporter of marine scientific research, he became an expert in his field. President Fidel Castro of Cuba would later call Wicklund “El Scientifico” for his knowledge of the oceans.</p>
          <p>In August 1976, Robert Wicklund met Senator Weicker for the first time when Senator Weicker visited Wicklund’s Hydro-lab in the Bahamas. From their first dive, Weicker gained a true respect for Wicklund and a real passion for the oceans, eventually taking primary control of oceans legislation for the Hydro-lab program through his position on the Senate Commerce Committee, and especially the Appropriation Committee with jurisdiction over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Hydro-Lab program eventually ran into funding problems, and Wicklund called Lowell Weicker to secure additional funding. Instead, the Senator offered Wicklund a job in Washington, D.C., as a legislative aide for oceans and environmental issues.</p>
          <p>From 1977 to 1982, Bob Wicklund worked with Weicker on Capitol Hill, helping to ensure funding for NOAA and oceans research particularly though the Appropriations process, as well as working on pollution and conservation legislation. Wicklund worked on the Sea Grant program, the Fisherman’s Contingency Fund, aquaculture, and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Amendments Act (PL 95-372). In addition, Weicker sent Wicklund to Mexico after the 1979 Ixtoc oil spill to monitor work on stopping the leak as well as subsequent cleanup efforts. </p>
          <p>In 1980, Senator Weicker and his staff, including Bob Wicklund, went to Cuba and met with Fidel Castro to discuss fisheries, ocean conservation, and scientific cooperation between the United States and Cuba. While scientists from Cuba did end up visiting the Hydro-Lab program, now in St. Croix Virgin Islands Bahamas Hydro-lab, the Reagan years brought back tension between the two countries and there was no further scientific exchange. </p>
          <p>In 1982, Wicklund decided to leave the Weicker staff, and since then has been executive director of a major marine research facility in the Exumas, Bahamas, and director of federal programs for the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. He also published papers, books, and studies on the oceans during this time.</p>
