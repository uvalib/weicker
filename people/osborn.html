      <h3>Timothy R. Osborn</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Timothy R. Osborn served Lowell Weicker on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Born in Tampa, Florida, Osborn graduated from Florida State University with a B.S. in Marine Biology and a secondary degree in Science Education in 1981. From there he went on to graduate from Louisiana State University in 1985 with a M.S. in Marine Sciences and a master’s in Public Administration. From 1985-86, Osborn participated in the NOAA Sea Grant Fellowship Program in Washington, D.C. The Sea Grant Program, which became a focus for Senator Weicker and staff aide Bob Wicklund, led Osborn to join the Weicker staff in 1986. </p>
          <p>During his time in the Senate, Osborn worked on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and the Small Business Committee. His time with Weicker, however, mainly stayed within the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. As a legislative staffer, Osborn, with the help of other legislative aides, advised Weicker on decisions related to energy, energy policies, and energy initiatives. He was responsible for analyzing recent studies, considering different sides of every argument, and sending off his and the staff’s opinion on the stance Weicker should take. While Osborn played an important role, Weicker would not always follow staff recommendations. </p>
          <p> Osborn was a key player in Weicker’s energy policy and legislation. Some of the key pieces of legislation Osborn worked on include Weicker’s numerous proposals for a gas tax as a conservation measure and reducing the deficit. Osborn advised Weicker on S. 801, the coal slurry pipeline, and potentially opening up area 1002 in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge. In addition, he developed Weicker’s opposition to the Iroquois Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline that would cut through parts of Connecticut.<br>
            Osborn worked with Weicker on legislation such as the Regulatory Fairness Act, which would allow FERC to require refunds to those who overpaid electric companies; the National Energy Appliance Act, which would mandate fluorescent bulbs in refrigerators, dryers, etc.; and the Price-Anderson Act amendments, which would address nuclear power plants’ liability to victims of hazardous waste. </p>
          <p>Osborn worked with Weicker up until 1988 when Weicker was defeated by Joe Lieberman, and continued his time as a Senate staffer until 1990. From 1990 to 1992, he worked as a manager in government affairs at ASEA Brown Boveri, Inc., in Washington, D.C. Since 1992, Osborn has worked for NOAA in the Office of Coast Survey and the National Marine Fisheries Service as a research biologist in Maryland and Louisiana.</p>
