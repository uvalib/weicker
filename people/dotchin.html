      <h3>Robert J. Dotchin</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Robert J. Dotchin is a former staff director of the U.S. Committee on Small Business and served 17 years in total on Capitol Hill. A Connecticut native, he has been involved in politics since a very young age. He majored in political science in college, served as an intern in the House Assembly in the State of Connecticut, and ran a summer intern program for Senator Weicker after graduating from the University of Connecticut. Following graduate school, Dotchin joined the Senator’s legislative operation in January 1973, only to be thrown into the high-profile Watergate controversy.</p>
          <p>He served as Legislative Director to Senator Weicker from 1975-76 and was his principal policy adviser during his first re-election campaign in 1976. In 1977, Weicker, then the ranking Republican on the Small Business Committee, asked Dotchin to form a staff for the Committee and to serve as his counsel. Dotchin remained counsel on the Committee up through the 1980 election, when Weicker became the chairman. From 1980, Dotchin oversaw major achievements in business legislation such as the Prompt Payment Act, Section 8(a) Set Aside Program, the 7(a) Loan Program, and the Small Business Innovation Research Program.</p>
          <p>Beginning in 1988, Dotchin served as senior vice president for a major trade association, directing a $1 million public affairs program. He also served as director of the Washington office for a Fortune 500 medical device corporation.</p>
          <p>Dotchin worked in some capacity on all three senatorial campaigns, and after Weicker’s defeat to Senator Joe Lieberman in 1988, he and a few others convinced Weicker to run as an independent for the Connecticut governorship in 1990.</p>
          <p>Dotchin is now a partner in The Advocacy Group, a public affairs firm located in Washington, D.C. The Advocacy Group provides counseling and assistance in government relations and public affairs to U.S. and international businesses, universities, medical centers, trade associations, coalitions, individuals, and government entities on a broad range of federal issues, and in particular represents the National Association of Small Business Investment Companies (NASBIC) before Congress and the executive branch.</p>
