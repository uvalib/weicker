      <h3>Jane E. West, Ph.D.</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Dr. Jane E. West served as senior policy analyst for the Presidential Commission on the HIV epidemic under President Ronald Reagan and was staff director of the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy under the leadership of Senator Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., of Connecticut. In that capacity she shepherded the reauthorization of several laws, including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Vocational Rehabilitation Act, and the Developmental Disabilities Act. She has published several articles on education policy issues, edited two books, and served on the faculties of the University of San Francisco and Johns Hopkins University. </p>
          <p>West joined the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) in February 2006, where she is senior vice president and director of the Department of Policy, Programs, and Professional Issues. She brings over 30 years of education and public policy experience to the organization as a former teacher, education administrator, PTA officer, researcher, and university faculty member. <br>
            <br>
            Since joining AACTE, West has led the organization’s effort to build a unified voice for educator preparation during the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and NCLB policy deliberations. She orchestrates AACTE’s annual “Day on the Hill,” has initiated numerous advocacy activities with AACTE state chapters, and leads the effort to increase federal funding for educator preparation. She received her BA from the University of California at Santa Barbara, her MA from Columbia University, and her Ph.D. from the University of Maryland.</p>
