      <h3>William J. Cibes</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>William (Bill) Cibes was born in Kansas and grew up as a self-described “farm boy.” He attended the University of Kansas and Princeton University before beginning his tenure at Connecticut College in 1969. In 1972 he decided to get involved in politics and became active in the Democratic Party. By 1974, Cibes contemplated a run for state representative but instead served on the local board of education. In 1978 he was elected to the House of Representatives in Connecticut, where he served for the next 12 years. </p>
          <p>During his time in the House, Bill Cibes continued teaching at Connecticut College, was active in the 1986 gubernatorial campaign for Bill O’Neill, and ran for Governor during the 1990 election. He lost the primary, but Tom D’Amore reached out and offered a position in Lowell Weicker’s gubernatorial administration. </p>
          <p>Bill Cibes served as Secretary of the Office of Public Management under Governor Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. Convinced that Connecticut could not sustain its revenue structure without tax reform, he worked tirelessly with Governor Weicker to establish the state’s income tax. In addition to his work on the income tax, Cibes was involved in the decisions to move forward with a tax on hospitals and running the tax through the Medicaid reimbursement system, getting the New England Patriots to come to Connecticut, and offering incentives to keep Pratt &amp; Whitney in Connecticut. </p>
          <p>Since his time working with Lowell Weicker, Cibes has served as Chancellor Emeritus for the Connecticut State University System. He continues to reside in Connecticut and has retired from his position as a professor of government. He remains active in numerous advocacy groups, community housing boards, and serves as a board member of the CT Mirror.</p>
