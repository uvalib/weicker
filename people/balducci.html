      <h3>Richard J. Balducci</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Richard J. Balducci’s political career began with his election in 1974 to the State House of Representatives from Connecticut’s 27 th District. He was appointed Assistant Majority Leader in 1981, Assistant Minority Leader in 1985, Deputy Majority Leader for the 1987-88 term, and finally, Speaker of the House for two terms beginning in 1989. During his career in the House, he also chaired several key committees, including Energy (1977-78); Labor (1979-80); and the Screening Committee (1987-88). Not wishing to break the two-term tradition for Speaker of the House, Balducci resigned his House seat, then ran successfully for the 9th District Senate seat in 1992. In 1994 he was a Democratic candidate for Governor.</p>
          <p>As state senator he served the towns of Newington, Cromwell, Rocky Hill, and parts of Wethersfield and Middletown. While in the senate, he was chair of the Regulation Review Committee and served on the Commerce Committee, Executive &amp; Legislative Nominations Committee, and the Legislative Management Committee.</p>
          <p>During his long political career he authored landmark legislation prohibiting sexual harassment in the workplace, sponsored the bill that raised Connecticut’s legal drinking age, worked on legislation that offers assistance to women and minority-owned businesses, and served as a consensus-builder and leader during the difficult fiscal crisis of 1991. Balducci never lost an election during his extended and distinguished career.</p>
          <p>Long active in community service, Balducci is currently chairman of the board of trustees for the Connecticut State University System. He served on the Drugs Don’t Work Task Force, was previously a member of the finance board for the Metropolitan District Commission, and served on the board of directors of the Newington Children’s Hospital. In 1989, Balducci was honored with the Gold Medal Award by the Italian American Home of Hartford for distinguished service and for his work on behalf of Italian Americans.</p>
          <p>Balducci earned a B.S. degree in Secondary Education from Central Connecticut State College in 1965. He was a partner in New England Recovery, an automobile salvage business, and currently is a partner at Doyle, D’Amore &amp; Balducci, a consulting and lobbying firm.</p>
          <p>Balducci married the former Carmella Matarazzo in 1964. They are the parents of five children: Paige, Leigh, Brett, Meagan, and Aaron, and the grandparents of nine.</p>
