      <h3>Steven Snider</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Steven Snider, born September 6, 1953, is a native to Topeka, Kansas. He attended the University of Maryland, where he earned his B.A. in Urban Studies in 1975. From there he went on to be a newspaper reporter in Missouri, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Washington, D.C. He continued his career as a special assistant to Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Mass), and served as communications director for Senator Carl Levin (D-Mich).</p>
          <p>In 1984, Snider joined Senator Lowell Weicker’s office as a committee investigator. In 1984, he assisted Weicker in his investigation of abuses of the mentally handicapped. That investigation led to Snider’s work on (S. 974) The Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Persons Act of 1985. He joined with Maureen Byrnes in conducting the study, preparing the report, and the legislation for that bill. In 1986, Snider became more involved as a press aide in Weicker’s office working with Andy McLeod. Throughout 1987, he took on more responsibility as Weicker’s official spokesman. Acting as press secretary and spokesman for the Weicker office, he oversaw the 1988 campaign efforts. He organized the office to stay in contact with the State of Connecticut through news coverage, commercials, and appearances. </p>
          <p>With the loss of the senatorial race in 1988, Snider went on to be partner at the media consultant firm MacWiliams, Cosgrove, Snider, Smith and Robinson. After his time at the firm, Snider became the president of King Harvest Communications (a media production and strategic communications firm), and in 1999, he was named EPA Associate Administrator in the office of communications, education, and media relations. From 1999 to early 2001 Snider served as chief agency spokesman.</p>
          <p>During his time in Weicker’s office, he dealt with issues surrounding education, health care reform, civil rights, AIDS research and education, rights of the mentally ill, the handicapped, and the environment.</p>
