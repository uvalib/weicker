      <h3>Claudia T. Weicker</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Claudia Testa Weicker was born to second-generation Italian parents and raised in Connecticut. From an early age, politics was a part of her home life. She recalls:</p>
          <p class="quote-block">“One of the earliest memories I have was a political conversation between my mother and father about the 1952 Presidential election…he was for Stevenson and my mother was for Eisenhower. In our home, dinner time was when these conversations took place and they always seemed to have time for our opinions as we were growing up.”</p>
          <p>Engagement in political conversation and exposure to politics fueled her interest in active participation. Her first involvement in politics was during the 1960 Presidential election, in which she volunteered at the Kennedy headquarters. There she worked for the Kennedy campaign by stuffing envelopes, attending phone banks, and passing out campaign literature. Throughout high school and college Claudia continued to work in local elections and offer her services whenever possible. She was, and remains, a Democrat.</p>
          <p>Claudia Testa attended The Hartford College for Women, a junior college, for two years before transferring to Marymount College where she graduated with a degree in economics in 1968. After college, Claudia’s initial plan was to move to New York City to work for a Wall Street firm, but an opportunity to work for Hubert Humphrey’s presidential campaign presented itself and Claudia could not refuse. In 1968, she joined the Humphrey campaign as an assistant to the southern regional director and was in charge of coordinating the southern state region. She maintained daily contact with campaign contacts, volunteers, and civil rights leaders.</p>
          <p>After the election, Claudia made a transition to the Office of International Trade at the Treasury Department but did not remain in this sector for very long. In mid-1969 Claudia began working with the Washington office of a Wall Street firm and remained in this position for approximately five years. Starting out as a research associate, Claudia worked her way to eventually become assistant vice president in the D.C. office. Her main focus of work was research for financial analysts regarding the effects of legislative initiatives and regulatory decisions in relation to large institutional investment firms. </p>
          <p>The year 1975 marked the beginning of Claudia’s involvement working with Senator Weicker when she took a job on the minority staff of the Subcommittee on Open Government of the Government Operations Committee. Her job as a legislative assistant on the Subcommittee was to track the progress of post-Watergate legislation for the Senator. She then went on to become minority staff director of the Subcommittee. As Senator Weicker moved between committees, Claudia also made job transitions and changes. In 1977, Claudia was offered a job on the majority staff of Government Operations, which she accepted. She continued to work on Watergate reform legislation, federal reorganization proposals, and civil service reform at a full Committee level.</p>
          <p>In 1981, Claudia became the first female in either house to be chosen as an appropriations “clerk,” which was the typical title for staff director. She continued in 1983 with her role as appropriations clerk on the Subcommittee on Health and Human Services. Claudia describes this work:</p>
          <p class="quote-block">“On both Appropriations Subcommittees we frequently found ourselves at odds with Reagan Administration policy and budget priorities: however, many worthwhile federal programs were saved from either elimination or crippling budget reductions… Federal Legal service, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, NOAA Oceans Programs, Fulbright Fellowships, regulatory enforcement programs, the National Institutes of Health and AIDS funding among them.” </p>
          <p>After working in this role as appropriations clerk, Claudia left her Senate work in 1985.</p>
          <p>In December 1984, Claudia married Senator Weicker. Since leaving work in politics, she has been active with various organizations and was the first lady of Connecticut from 1991-95. In 2006 Claudia chaired the Affiliates Survive and Conquer Symposium for the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation. As a breast cancer survivor, she has been involved with various organizations involved in that work.</p>
          <p style="text-align:center">***</p>
          <p>When asked about the office environment and the balance between staff control and Senator Weicker, Claudia notes that the staff was given great independence to manage and complete the given responsibilities. While the staff had great autonomy, Senator Weicker’s interests and priorities in regards to legislation were constantly made clear to the staff. Senator Weicker was incredibly in tune with the ins and outs of the office and his staff, and gave his team significant amounts of mobility and liberty in which to have active roles. However, it was also clear that the Senator acted as a guiding force and had the final decision-making power, which subjected the work of his staff to his criticism and critique.</p>
          <p>When asked to further elaborate the relationship between Senator Weicker and his staff, Claudia stated,</p>
          <p class="quote-block">“We coordinated with his personal legislative and other Committee staff regarding overlapping legislation. For example, the authorization for disabilities programs was in the Senate Education and Labor Committee and he was the chair of the Disabilities Subcommittee. We worked closely with his staff on the Subcommittee when it came time for the appropriations and any negotiations with the House Committee over funding. His ‘senior staff,’ which included his legislative assistant and the staff directors of his committees and subcommittees would meet regularly with him—usually at the end of the day in his Capitol ‘hideaway’ office. These meetings could occur daily, depending on Senate activity.”</p>
          <p>Claudia also explained how well the staff worked together. She attributes this successful rapport among the staff to the fact that Senator Weicker set the rules of the office. Due to his guidelines and rules, there was no room for the staff to have problems or “turf battles” because there were clear boundaries and lines of authority. </p>
          <p>In the case of an issue, there was a certain process and means of addressing the situation that staff would follow. The staff was relied upon to help “minimize dispute within his committees” and to find a common ground to keep legislation mobilized without disagreement or unnecessary delays. Thus the office was run efficiently, given its clear boundary and authority lines and the strong focus on keeping legislation and issues moving rather than becoming stagnant. Senator Weicker’s presence and strong rapport with his staff and regarding decisions helped to maintain certain parameters of daily office life, which also helped keep things running smoothly, competently, and proficiently.</p>
