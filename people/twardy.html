      <h3>Stanley A. Twardy, Jr.</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Stanley Twardy worked in several capacities for Lowell Weicker from 1977 to 1993. He attended Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, graduating in 1973 with a degree in physics. He attended law school at the University of Virginia and graduated in 1976. In 1977, Twardy began working for Weicker on the Small Business Committee. During his time on the Committee, Twardy dealt with tax privacy matters, the Ethics and Government Act, the Chrysler bailout in 1979, Section 8(a) and general small business issues. </p>
          <p>During the Amtrak budget fights in the late 1970s, when Weicker was arguably most involved in the issue, Twardy was also listed as primary contact in letters to Senators and other important officials regarding Amtrak. Though he left in December of 1980, he continued to be closely involved with Weicker’s office. </p>
          <p>In 1985, President Ronald Reagan nominated Stanley Twardy to U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut. Twardy remained U.S. Attorney until 1991. When Weicker was elected Governor in 1990, Twardy rejoined the Weicker team, serving as chief of staff from 1991-93 (joint chief of staff with Tom D’Amore from 1991-92). During his time as chief of staff, Twardy worked on such major issues as the Indian Gaming Commission and the implementation of the income tax. In 1993, Twardy left the Governor’s office to return to the private practice of law.</p>
          <p>In August of 2009, Twardy was appointed as monitor of WellCare Health Plans, Inc., a managed care health organization, pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement between the Department of Justice and the company. Today he is a partner at Day Pitney LLP in Stamford, Connecticut.</p>
