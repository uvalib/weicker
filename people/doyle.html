      <h3>John Doyle</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>John Doyle served in a number of legislative support positions for Senator Weicker, both in the U.S. Senate and in the Connecticut executive office. In Congress, Doyle worked as majority staff director for Senator Weicker, also serving as majority staff director for the Senate Subcommittee on the Handicapped. In this position, Doyle worked for a variety of measures, most notably the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), cosponsored by both Senator Weicker and Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1990.</p>
          <p>During his Committee tenure, Doyle also devoted himself to maintaining an appropriate budget for carrying out the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 after heading off a 1981 attempt by the Reagan Administration to repeal the law in its entirety. ''Congress promised to pay 40 percent of the excess costs of special education by 1981,'' said Doyle. ''They never got over 10 percent. In New York State, where some 250,404 handicapped children are in public schools, the Federal Government pays only 5 percent of the costs. . . . Right now, we’re fighting to save what we’ve got.''</p>
          <p>After Weicker lost his 1988 reelection bid to Democrat Joe Lieberman, Doyle became the administrator of the National Council on Disabilities, a newly independent federal agency that owed its 1984 birth from the Department of Education to the earlier work of both John Doyle and Lowell Weicker. The idea of creating an independent council came from Doyle.</p>
          <p>John Doyle has served as chief executive of both state and national trade associations and now is president of the consulting firm Doyle, D’Amore and Balducci, which lobbies the federal government for various public policies on behalf of corporate clients.</p>
