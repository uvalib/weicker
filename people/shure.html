      <h3>H. William Shure</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>H. William Shure was born in 1940 in New Haven, Connecticut. After graduating from Dartmouth College and receiving his law degree from the University of Virginia in 1964, Shure returned to Connecticut to practice law with Sachs, Sachs Giaimo &amp; Sachs, specializing mainly in bankruptcy and commercial cases. Shure became deeply involved in Connecticut politics, and after meeting Lowell Weicker in 1970, served as part-time manager of the Weicker office in New Haven and in the role of campaign lieutenant.</p>
          <p>When the Watergate Committee was formed in February 1973 to investigate possible illegal conduct during the 1972 elections, Shure was invited by Governor Weicker to join the Watergate inquiry. On March 11, 1973 Shure was named assistant minority counsel of the special Senate Committee assigned to the investigation of Watergate bugging and political espionage. While he acted as first assistant to Senator Fred Thompson, chief minority counsel, Weicker himself admitted that, “Shure in effect was half Committee aide, half Weicker aide.” Shure, while putting in many long and hard hours, was privy to exclusive information and was present during the interviews and testimonies of Watergate’s main players, such as John Mitchell, H.R. Haldeman, and John Ehrlichman. He played a key role in Weicker’s private investigation and was crucial to exposing the breadth of the crimes by the Nixon Administration. Shure remained with Weicker on the Watergate Committee only until mid-October due to his commitment with Sachs, Sachs, Giaimo &amp; Sachs. </p>
          <p>After Watergate, Shure stayed involved with Weicker in three out of his four senatorial campaigns, and during Weicker’s time as Governor. In 1976 Shure worked as Weicker’s campaign manager. Shure took became National Finance Chairman in 1982, and while he was involved with the 1988 campaign, he did not take an official title due to his relationship with Senator Joseph Lieberman. During Weicker’s governorship, Shure worked in various departments doing legal work.</p>
          <p>Today, Shure is a prominent lawyer in Connecticut, working with Pullman &amp; Comley as chair of the firm’s commercial finance section. He has represented Connecticut’s Department of Economic and Community Development, served on the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Operations, the Subcommittee on Federal Spending Practices, Efficiency and Open Government, and has served as the U.S. Air Force legal advisor to the U.S. Embassy in Paris.</p>
