      <h3>Kimberly Elliott</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>Kimberly Elliott began her work with Lowell Weicker in 1980 through the Committee on Small Business under Gaylord Nelson (D-WI). With the Republican takeover of 1980, Nelson had to relinquish the chairmanship of the Committee, and Weicker’s staff director, Bob Dotchin, asked Elliott to join the Weicker legislative staff. Elliott began her work for Weicker as a translator, due to her mastery of multiple languages, and worked on getting federal contracts to minority owners of small businesses and small businesses in general.</p>
          <p>In 1983, Elliott joined Senator Weicker’s personal staff and operated as his legislative director from 1983 to 1988. Elliott’s tasks were multifaceted and numerous. Her primary duties included acting as a liaison between Senator Weicker and the rest of his staff, developing and maintaining a calendar of all of the Senator’s activities, and staying up-to-date on every piece of legislation active in Congress. Weicker’s aides submitted briefs and memos from Weicker’s committees to Elliott updating her on the various issues being considered. While these memos would sometimes be submitted directly to Weicker, Elliott would often submit her own briefs to him after receiving briefs from the staff. Aides, including Elliott, suggested in these briefs the action they believed Weicker should take on each issue.</p>
          <p>Every morning, Elliott and Weicker would discuss the day’s likely agenda over breakfast and then coordinate all legislative activity between the Committee staff and the personal staff. Senior staff and Committee staff members reported on their respective assignments to Elliott, and she in turn would send recommendations to Weicker on certain issues.</p>
          <p>Some of the major issues during Elliott’s tenure included small business, abortion, Title X, HIV/AIDS, anti-apartheid, combating the far right’s attempts to alter the Constitution (school prayer, War Powers Act, separation of church and state), and pushing for legislation that would benefit the citizens of Connecticut.</p>
          <p>In 1983, Weicker sent Elliott to Cuba intent on having her return with American hostages being held on drug trafficking charges. Complications arose, and Elliott alone helped ensure the safe and timely return of three American women who had overdosed on prison barbiturates.</p>
          <p>During her time as Weicker’s legislative director, she and Weicker developed a close personal relationship. When Weicker’s tenure in the Senate ended in 1988, Elliott maintained contact with Weicker and eventually worked for him on the 1995 Special Olympics in Connecticut. Today, Kim Elliott resides in Washington, D.C., and continues to work with Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.</p>
<p>Elliott assisted then Senator Weicker in managing his responsibilities on the following committees: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Small Business</li>
            <li> Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, the Subcommittee on the Handicapped</li>
