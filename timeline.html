The Republican candidate, John Rowland, captures 38%, while the Democrat candidate, Bruce Morrison, garners 20%. Weicker was the clear frontrunner throughout much of the campaign, but Morrison closed the gap by exploiting the issue of the state income tax. Weicker was against creating a state income tax, but felt it prudent, given the state’s finances, to keep &ldquo;everything on the table.&rdquo;  Rowland strongly opposed the tax and suggested Weicker was for it. His strategy was effective until Weicker ran a new ad: &ldquo;Stop distorting facts and scaring people with misquotes and half-truths. Long before your negative ads, I was opposed to a state income tax. The people of Connecticut and I know it would be like pouring gasoline on the fires of recession. And nobody’s for that.&rdquo;</div>

                <div class="timeline-details">In a highly controversial and difficult move, Weicker calls for the creation of a state personal income tax in his budget message to the Connecticut General Assembly delivered in a statewide address. The state’s annual deficit had risen to $963 million since the end of the gubernatorial campaign, out of a total budget of $7 billion, and threatened to rise to $2.4 billion in one year given the broader economic recession facing the nation. Weicker also calls for cuts to the state sales tax and the elimination of a corporate tax surcharge. Weicker further calls for cuts in spending, including in government services, which he later notes for him personally was the toughest part of introducing his new fiscal plan. His budget proposal kicks off six months of intense political fighting.</div>
