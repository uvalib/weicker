          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>Senator Lowell Weicker established his career as an independent-minded politician during the Watergate scandal. Throughout his senatorial career, Weicker did not decide his vote based on party lines; instead he used the Constitution as his guiding principle. His constitution-based philosophy led the Senator to cross party lines, become one of the most outspoken Senators on the floor, and earned him the nickname “Maverick.” Senator Weicker successfully ran as an independent for the Connecticut governorship in 1990. Today, he continues to live by the same guiding principles of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <h4>As a Congressman</h4>
          <p> Senator Weicker’s legislative career spanned a number of important foreign policy landmarks. When he entered the House in 1968, Weicker was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War. During the Watergate hearings and investigation, he repeatedly butted heads with Republicans who thought his “third front” investigation was overreaching and detrimental to the Party. Senator Weicker, using the U.S. Constitution as his guiding light, remained steadfast and emerged as a political hero in the aftermath of Watergate. </p>
          <p> As part of his dedication to “constitutional values,” he became the “nemesis” of Jesse Helms in the 1980s, who he initially clashed with over court-ordered busing. As the government determined its response to the AIDS epidemic, Weicker continued to come up against Senator Helms. Weicker remained primarily concerned with the preservation of human rights, AIDS prevention, and education here in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
          <p>Moreover, his voting philosophy resulted in Senator Weicker increasingly allying with Democrats, eventually garnering a 90 percent approval rating from Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), higher than the average for both Democrats and Republicans. In the 1988 re-election campaign, the Lieberman campaign attacked Senator Weicker for his common alignment with the Democratic Party and not being conservative enough (Interview, Lowell Weicker). </p>
          <h4>Gubernatorial Career</h4>
          <p> After a two-year absence from politics, Senator Lowell Weicker extended his political career by running and winning the governorship of Connecticut in 1990. In considering the run for office, Weicker made the decision to break off from the Republican Party, citing that &quot;it was the party that changed, not me&quot; (&quot;Background&quot;). This formal break with the GOP stemmed from the Republican Party's growing conservatism and its failure to support him in the 1988 election against Joe Lieberman. </p>
          <p>After his split with the Republican Party, Weicker formed his own independent party, naming it &quot;A Connecticut Party&quot; to ensure the party's candidate would appear at the top of the ballot (Hume). After garnering over ten times the signatures needed to get his name on the ballot, the Senator began his aggressive campaign against Republican John Rowland and Democrat Bruce Morrison (Schwartz).</p>
          <p>His opponents believed Weicker's campaign would be a disaster and asserted that the two parties would not work well with an independent Governor. Weicker, however, proved his critics wrong as he swept up 40 percent of the vote to win the governorship (Shribman). Republican John Rowland collected 37 percent of the vote, and Democrat Bruce Morrison collected 20 percent (Shapiro). </p>
          <p> Governor Weicker’s campaign for an income tax was prompted by massive state budget deficits, as well as the need to reduce taxes on sales items and businesses. Yet instituting the tax prompted enormous backlash from Connecticut constituents, including the largest protest ever held in the state.</p>
          <p>Weicker only served one term but was instrumental in the passage and adoption of Connecticut's income tax in 1991 (Shapiro; Interview). Weicker immediately moved to pass a personal income tax once elected, asserting that his third party status would protect both Republicans and Democrats in the state’s legislature from electoral repercussions. Meanwhile, Weicker vetoed every state budget that did not include a personal income tax. The tax issue resulted in a great deal of public antipathy towards Weicker, but his approach was eventually successful, and Connecticut retains the tax today. Weicker’s successful work garnered him recognition as one of the recipients of John F. Kennedy’s Profiles in Courage awards. </p>
          <p>Other gubernatorial issues promoted by Weicker reflect longstanding concerns about education and health equitability in America, though these goals were often achieved as a result of funding cuts in programs for the elderly and poor in cash-strapped Connecticut. Weicker unsuccessfully promoted a busing plan for Connecticut school children and worked far more successfully for federal assistance to institute a workable private/public long-term health care accessibility plan. As promised, Weicker serves only one term, and his A Connecticut Party disintegrates in the years after he retires from government service.</p>

            <h5>1968 vs. Donald Irwin</h5>
            <p> In 1968, Weicker ran and won his first federal election against Donald Irwin. Lowell Weicker was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Connecticut's 4th District. In his interview, Lowell Weicker attributes the success of his campaign to Irwin's stance on Vietnam and Abe Ribicoff. Irwin's misfires during the 1968 campaign made the election easier for Weicker to win. Weicker also stressed the importance of &quot;pressing the flesh&quot; and street campaigning (Weicker).</p>

            <h5>1970 vs. Joseph Duffy</h5>
            <p> Following his two years in the House of Representatives, Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., ran and won a U.S. Senate seat in 1970. While at first Senator Weicker was reluctant to run for Senate, he seized the opportunity to run on the same ticket as Thomas Meskill. With both conservative and liberal ticket personalities, the two candidates easily won their intended campaigns. Weicker would remain in the Senate seat for 18 years until 1988 (Weicker).</p>

            <h5>1976 vs. Gloria Schaffer</h5>
            <p> In 1976, Lowell Weicker defended and won his Senate seat against Connecticut's Secretary of State, Gloria Schaffer. The 1976 election raised questions as to whether Connecticut was ready for a woman Senator, and whether Senator Weicker's popularity from Watergate would carry him through the election. Weicker's wide popularity with both Republicans and Democrats from his involvement in the Watergate investigation proved to be more than enough to secure his seat in the Senate (Fellows). Senator Weicker admits the 1976 campaign was his easiest campaign to win due to his Watergate stardom, legacy, and support from Republicans (Weicker).</p>

            <h5>1982 vs. Tobey Moffett</h5>
            <p> In one of the hardest fought campaigns, Lowell Weicker successfully defended his seat in the Senate against Democrat Toby Moffett. Senator Weicker admits the 1982 election was the toughest, with Weicker only beating Moffett 52 to 46 percent. During this campaign, Weicker's strategy was to appeal to the middle of Connecticut and showcase his left-leaning tendencies (Weicker).</p>
            <p class="sources">SOURCE: Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., Interview 1 with Phyllis Leffler, 20 April 2010.</p>
            <h5>1988 vs. Joe Lieberman</h5>
            <p> In his final Senate election, Lowell was unable to defend his seat in the Senate and lost to then Democrat Joe Lieberman. Weicker attributes his defeat to poor campaign execution, attitude of entitlement, and Lieberman's strategy to attack Weicker from the right (Weicker). Joe Lieberman, in an effort to rally middle and conservative Connecticut voters, portrayed Weicker as too liberal for the state. With the help of William F. Buckley, his BucPac, and the pages of <span class="work-title">The National Journal</span>, Senator Weicker faced opposition in the polls, the media, and the voters (Shapiro). While only losing by less than one percent, Weicker did not ask for a recount and surrendered his seat in the Senate.</p>

            <h5>1990 vs. Bruce Morrison &amp; John Rowland</h5>
            <p> After a two-year absence from politics, Senator Lowell Weicker extended his political career by running and winning the governorship of Connecticut in 1990. In considering the run for office, Weicker made the decision to break off from the Republican party, citing that &quot;it was the party that changed, not me&quot; (&quot;Background&quot;). This formal break with the GOP stemmed from the Republican Party's growing conservatism and its failure to support him in the 1988 election against Joe Lieberman. </p>
            <p>After his split with the Republican Party, Weicker formed his own independent party, naming it &quot;A Connecticut Party&quot; to ensure the party's candidate would appear at the top of the ballot (Hume). Because Weicker was running as an independent, he needed to acquire enough signatures from voters to be on the ballot. By July 29, 1990, he had filed over 105,000 petition signatures (10 times the number needed to place his name on the November ballot) and began his aggressive campaign against Republican John Rowland and Democrat Bruce Morrison (Schwartz &amp; Walker). </p>
            <p>His opponents believed Weicker's campaign would be a disaster and asserted that the two parties would not work well with an independent Governor. Weicker, however, proved his critics wrong as he swept up 40 percent of the vote to win the Governorship (Shribman). Republican John Rowland collected 37 percent of the vote and Democrat Bruce Morrison collected 20 percent (Shapiro). During the race, Weicker ran on a platform of “work for the children, not the politicians.” While he stayed clear of specifics, Weicker garnered enough support from the voters to win (“Weicker Beats...”). In addition, Governor Weicker vowed to solve the state's financial crisis and to only serve one term. He was instrumental in the passage and adoption of Connecticut's income tax in 1991 (Shapiro; Interview).</p>

            <h5>1983 Hostage Negotiation</h5>
            <p> In March 1983, Lowell Weicker visited Cuba and spoke with Fidel Castro regarding the release of American hostages. A group of women, mostly Connecticut residents, had been captured and charged with drug trafficking. Fidel Castro agreed to release the American women. Lowell Weicker sent his staffer, Kim Elliott, in a friend's private plane to the island to pick up the hostages and return them to Miami. Unfortunately, the American hostages upheld a previous pact in which they agreed to end their lives through prison-distributed barbiturates and overdosed on the tarmac. With doctor's release, Elliott was able to negotiate the return trip for these women. Elliott returned to Miami, Florida, with the three girls (1).</p>
            <p class="sources">SOURCE: (1) Kim Elliott interview with Phyllis Leffler, August 12, 2010.</p>
            <h5>Cuban-U.S. Relations</h5>
            <p> Weicker’s trips to Cuba during the 1980s were predominantly conservation-focused, but he also discussed non-oceanic subjects with Fidel Castro. In 1980, Weicker visited Cuba with scientific research as the focus of the trip. As a result of his first visit, Weicker was responsible for creating a coalition between American and Cuban scientists as they worked together in the Hydro-lab (1,2,3). Scientists from both nations collaborated in the Bahamas Islands to share knowledge and information regarding underwater research, weather, and climate information. In 1983, a number of Senators asked Weicker to negotiate the release of several American prisoners. Weicker's visit resulted in the release of the prisoners. Weicker's aide, Kim Elliott, supervised and participated in the safe return of the American citizens (4,5,6).</p>
            <p class="sources">SOURCES: (1,2,3) Kim Elliott Box 31 – “Cuba Trip, 1983 – Briefs, Meetings, Documents;” “Cuba Trip Report 1980;” “Cuba – Weicker Trips, 1980, 1983: Issues, Prisoners, Handwritten Preparations…” (4) Lowell P.

            <h5>Talks with Fidel Castro</h5>
            <p> In 1980, during Weicker's first visit to Cuba, he and his legislative aide, Bob Wicklund, met and conversed with Fidel Castro. The goal of this first visit was to discuss a cooperative science program between Cuba and the United States. As a part of this partnership, teams of scientists from both the U.S. and Cuba would gather at St. Croix in the Virgin Islands and dive on the Hydro-lab. The team spent a week underwater in the Hydro-lab and began the some of the first scientific exchanges between the U.S. and Cuba. In his interview, Bob Wicklund admits that their visit to Cuba did not accomplish &quot;a lot of science,&quot; but the opportunity for communication and scientific exchange was a significant diplomatic step. In addition to the scientific cooperative, Weicker and Castro discussed Cuba's health program, dairy production, fisheries, and the protection of sea turtles. As a part of this trip, Weicker and Wicklund spent time with Castro on his personal boat and stayed in Cuba for four days. In 1983, Weicker would return to Cuba.</p>
            <p class="sources">SOURCE: Robert I. Wicklund interview with Phyllis Leffler, April 2010.</p>
            <h5>Labor, Health and Human Services</h5>
            <p> When Senator Lowell Weicker was appointed Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education in 1983, he secured the first budget for domestic and social programs in five years. In 1984, Weicker chaired a hearing to review the Justice Department’s record on enforcing the civil rights of mentally retarded institutionalized individuals. Weicker staff members Maureen Byrnes, Steven Snider, and Terry Muilenburg visited numerous facilities and organized the report for the Committee. Weicker also authorized legislation that appropriated $75,000 per year for a joint research venture between the University of Connecticut and the U.S. Department of Education Research and Training Center, focused on pediatric rehabilitation. In the mid to late 1980s, Weicker's position on the Labor Health and Human Services Committee was instrumental in getting AIDS legislation for funding and research passed.          </p>
