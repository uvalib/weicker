          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>Senator Lowell Weicker’s advocacy on behalf of small, minority-owned, and women-owned businesses emanated from his belief that small businesses should have a fair share of the pie. In a time of fiscal conservatism and a budget crisis, Weicker was a leader among a group of moderate Republicans who worked together to create a balanced budget. From 1980 to 1986, Senator Weicker served as the chair of the Senate Select Small Business Committee. During his time on the Committee, he came up against efforts by the Reagan Administration to cut funding to small businesses. Moreover, Senator Weicker worked with other Congressmen to encourage moderate and responsible fiscal policies that worked to balance the budget rather than appease political party ideologies.</p>

          <h4>&ldquo;Gang of Five&rdquo;</h4>
          <p>As Congress struggled to balance the budget, Senator Weicker and the “Gang of Five” offered up multiple alternative budget solutions. Weicker worked alongside Senators Chafee (R-RI), Hatfield (R-OR), Mathias (R-MD), and Stafford (R-VT). Together they advocated for a budget plan that would increase funding to social service programs, limit defense spending to 5 percent of the budget (as opposed to 13 percent), while slightly increasing taxes. The Reagan Administration repeatedly countered the Gang’s alternative budgets with budgets that increased defense spending and sought to cut funds to small businesses and domestic social programs.          </p>
          <p>Senator Weicker encouraged policies that did not espouse political ideologies over fiscal responsibility. For example, Senator Domenici’s (R-NM) and Chiles’ (D-FL) amendments to the Balanced Budget bill sought to (1) restrict the executive’s ability to alter and shape the congressional budget, (2) leave the authority to shape how the bill will be enforced to Congress, rather than the executive, and (3) provide a more flexible method for determining “national income” (Washington Post, 7/27/1982). Lowell Weicker spoke against these amendments, citing them as “voodoo economics.”          </p>
          <h4>Chairmanship</h4>
          <p> In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected along with a Republican majority in the Senate, leaving Republicans and Senator Weicker with control over the Senate Select Small Business Committee. Weicker supported giving small and minority-owned businesses a portion of government procurement funds, while Reagan opposed such measures. While the chairmanship provided Weicker with a larger staff, a method of pursuing his own policy initiatives, and a pulpit for his beliefs and goals, most believe that little could and did change.          </p>
          <p>Senator Weicker offered up “five ideas for help” to specifically assist small business and economic rehabilitation. His demands included 1) ensuring that small businesses receive a “fair share” of government contact dollars, 2) the passage of the Delinquent Payments Act, which would force the government to pay its bills to contractors in four to six weeks, 3) reinstitution of the small-issue industrial bond program, 4) passage of the Regulatory Reform Act, “which would require federal agencies to evaluate the costs and benefits of major rules before imposing them,” and more generally, 5) a loosening of regulations and financial restrictions placed on small businesses.          </p>
          <h4>Small Business Administration</h4>
          <p> In 1981 Weicker began work as chair of the Small Business Committee, vowing to “clean up” the Small Business Administration (SBA) after allegations that the nearly 30-year-old agency was plagued by fraud and faulty lending practices. Over time, Weicker continued to support both the SBA and its directors, while the House Small Business Committee Chair Parren Mitchell (D-MD) grew increasingly critical of the SBA, asserting that it was mismanaged and followed political winds rather than responding to minority needs (Chicago Tribune, 8/21/1983). Amidst allegations of corruption, mismanagement, and nepotism, the House passed legislation to “revamp” the SBA’s 8(a) program. Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Dale Bumpers (D-AK) and Senator Weicker put forth their own bill in the Senate.          </p>
          <p>In 1986, once Republicans became the minority party in the Senate, Lowell Weicker continued to work closely with Senator Dale Bumpers to oppose the Reagan Administration’s attempts to cut programs for small business (Washington Post, 11/06/1986). As a member of the Small Business Committee, Senator Weicker was highly involved in establishing, facilitating, and propagating the needs and wants of small business owners.</p>

            <h5>Prompt Payment Act</h5>
            <p> The Prompt Payment Act helped facilitate business between government and its contractors. The law (still on the books) requires federal agencies to pay their debts to the federal government within 45 days or face interest charges (<span class="work-title">Chicago Tribune</span>). As such, the law facilitated better business relations between the federal government and its contractors by specifying the amount in interest penalties the government must pay in case of late payments, and encouraged all agencies to pay on time by providing a prompt payment discount (Lambert). Backed by small business contractors, Senator Lowell Weicker, and many others, the Prompt Payment Act swiftly passed both the House and Senate in June of 1982 (<span class="work-title">Chicago Tribune</span>). Senator Weicker supported the bill because it took “a major step to clear up what is one of the most pressing and frustrating problems facing small businesses – failure by the government to pay its bills on time” (<span class="work-title">Chicago Tribune</span>). </p>

            <h5>Section 7(a) Loan Program</h5>
            <p> The 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program was designed to meet the needs of America’s entrepreneurs. The program aimed to help small business owners start or expand their business by making capital more easily accessible. By providing capital through both bank and non-bank facilities, the program allows new or expanding business to gain access to long-term loans (Comptroller General). In 1983, the General Accounting Office (GAO) investigated the “credit gap,” the role of private investors, and how to improve the Loan Guarantee Program. As it began, Chairman Weicker asked the GAO to respond to several issues. Senator Weicker urged the GAO to study the role of the 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program, the selling of loans to private investors, and the Small Business Administration’s policies on regulating interest rates (Comptroller General).</p>

            <h5>Section 8(a) Small Business Act</h5>
            <p> Named for Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, this program was created to help small and disadvantaged businesses compete in the marketplace. It also helps these companies gain access to federal and private procurement markets (1). The 8(a) Business Development Program assists in the development of small businesses owned and operated by individuals who are socially and economically disadvantaged, such as women and minorities. In 1981, Senator Weicker introduced S. 1620, an amendment to the Small Business Act to prohibit the SBA from entering into government procurement contracts set aside for small businesses (3).</p>

            <h5>Set Aside Program</h5>
            <p> Senator Weicker was involved in the planning and development of S.B. No. 591. This act was a set-aside program for small contractors and minority business enterprises. The bill would also allow municipalities to expand set-aside programs for the construction industry, including minority business enterprises (1). This amendment was a part of SBA 8(a) procurement program and offered $66.1 million (2).</p>
