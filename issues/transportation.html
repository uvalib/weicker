          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>As a native to New England, Lowell Weicker knew the importance of an efficient, effective, and affordable transportation system. Starting in the 1970s as a member of the Transportation Committee, Weicker helped initiate the creation of Amtrak, and for years to come would be Amtrak’s “best friend on Capitol Hill” (<span class="work-title">New York Times</span> 11/5/77). During times of budget cuts and faltering faith in the public transportation system, Weicker helped ensure the freight and rail lines remained open to those in the Northeast.</p>

          <h4>Amtrak and Rail Transportation</h4>
          <p> Senator Weicker began his involvement in transportation issues while a member of the House, where he was appointed chairman of the House Public Ground Transportation Subcommittee. The creation of Amtrak in 1970 directly affected Weicker’s Northeastern constituents, ensuring that public transportation funding, access, and safety would remain near the top of the Senator’s priority list during his congressional tenure. Indeed, railroad safety guideline legislation was some of the first legislation that Senator Weicker cosponsored. He subsequently sponsored a variety of bills intended to construct a national public rail transportation network, a dream that was never realized due to persistent financial problems encountered by the always financially and infrastructure-challenged rail system.</p>
          <p>As chairman of the House Public Ground Transportation Committee, Weicker studied all forms of ground transportation and made recommendations to solve transit problems and improve service in the country (Transportation Box 10, Transportation Box 1). Weicker authorized the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe the rules and regulations for railroad safety (Transportation Box 4). </p>
          <p>In 1972, Weicker won Congressional approval to provide $100,000 to research the possibility of a public, government-run transportation system. Congress later went one step further and asked President Richard Nixon for $900 million to go towards urban mass transit (Transportation Box 1). With this grant, Weicker hoped to lay the groundwork for a coordinated federal transportation system that controlled and operated railroad tracks, signal systems, right of way, and other fixed facilities (Transportation Box 10). Weicker later introduced the Interstate Railroad Act of 1974 that established a national network of rail lines and curbed derailment on railways (<span class="work-title">Congressional Record</span> 4/10/74). </p>
          <p>In 1976, Weicker introduced the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act to keep Amtrak alive, and again in 1978 Weicker provided Amtrak with a subsidy to keep the Northeast corridor open and set up a marketable rail network. When Amtrak faced losing funding due to deregulation, Weicker fought to extend appropriations for three years from 1979 to 1981 (<span class="work-title">Congressional Record</span> 3/21/79). As Weicker headed into the 1980s, Amtrak faced even sharper budget cuts, and eventually Amtrak cut its services in all regions except the Northeast corridor because it remained the most commercially viable region in the nation (Hall Box 4).</p>
          <p>In addition to Amtrak, Weicker was involved with legislation in the New Haven Railroad and the Conrail freight lines. Under his initiatives, freight and rail lines flourished in the New England region. Rail lines were not just a matter of public transportation to the big cities, but affected the commercial life of the region. While rail issues were important to Weicker, there were other issues involved with transportation.</p>
          <h4>Related Issues</h4>
          <p> Due to the wide range of issues the Transportation Committee can cover, Weicker was also involved in the Animal Welfare Act in 1976. While the treatment of animals was usually an issue confined to the home or a laboratory, the transportation of animals in airplanes became an issue in the 1970s. Weicker ensured the treatment of animals in the air was the same as on the ground.</p>
          <p>During Weicker’s career, he intertwined transportation with other issues such as energy and conservation. Throughout the 1970s, Senator Weicker called for gas taxes, gas rationing, and mandates that allotted cars only six days a week on the road (Osborn Box 4). While his initiatives may have had a conservation foundation, fewer cars on the road would be good for the environment as well as for the traffic-congested area of New England. </p>
          <p>Weicker remained an ardent supporter of public rail transportation through the 1980s, when the Reagan Administration and the Republican Party began an attack on federally funded public interest programs. However, the Northeast lines upon which Connecticut passengers most relied faced bankruptcy almost immediately after the consolidation of Amtrak. </p>
          <p>Throughout his career, Weicker fought for Amtrak and public transportation, not because it was supposed to make money, but to provide vital commuter services to the New England area and Connecticut constituents. The fuel efficiency of Amtrak allowed the program to survive through the gas shortage years of the 1970s, but Weicker’s battles for Amtrak continuation during the 1980s were far less effective. While serving on the Transportation Committee, Weicker’s aides Geoffrey Baker (1972-82), Stan Twardy (late 1970s), and Maureen Byrnes (1983–84) helped push legislation and initiatives to the Senate floor. </p>

            <h5>Amtrak Budget</h5>
            <p> In 1969, Weicker organized a meeting to merge federal and state government efforts to improve commuter trains. As a result of this meeting, he would propose the establishment of a coordinated mass transit system in the Northeast (<span class="work-title">Congressional Record</span> 4/15/1969) (1). With H.J. Resolution 1288, Weicker appropriated funds for a study to find out how feasible government acquisition, operation, and maintenance of railroad lines would be. Weicker hoped this study would lay the groundwork for Amtrak (2). <br>
              <br>
              By May 1971, Amtrak was officially organized, beginning with $40 million in direct federal aid and $100 million in federal loans. While there were dissenters of the creation of Amtrak, Weicker and others continuously fought and won $170 million more in appropriations to run through 1973 (3). Only a few years after its creation, Amtrak faced its first major cut in funding in 1974. Secretary of Transportation Claude Brinegar began questioning Amtrak and its federal funding. Weicker asked Brinegar to either commit to Amtrak or make the 40 percent cuts he proposed (4), which led to the Interstate Railroad Act that provided $1.5 million in rehabilitation of railroad lines and $1 billion in loans (5). </p>
            <p>By the end of the decade, Secretary of Transportation Brock Adams submitted a plan to make a 43 percent cut in Amtrak services. With the early 1980s came more attacks on the Amtrak budget, all of which Weicker would fight to save funding and retain routes for the Northeast corridor. In 1985, Weicker helped the Senate kill an amendment that would eliminate funds for Amtrak. Weicker voted with the overwhelming majority to retain the money, helping Amtrak survive another round of budget battles. </p>

            <h5>Animal Welfare Act of 1976</h5>
            <p> The Animal Welfare Act Amendments of 1976 tightened legislation of illegal and inhumane animal transportation and added an amendment outlawing animal fighting and specifically dog fighting. The ability to regulate animal treatment at the federal level stemmed from a broad interpretation of federal authority over interstate commerce. This bill was one of the first major pieces of legislation that Geoffrey Baker and Lowell Weicker worked on (1).</p>

            <h4>Conrail</h4>
            <p> Conrail, the Consolidated Rail Corporation, was a regional rail company serving the New England corridor. In the mid-1970s, Amtrak acquired Conrail's lines with Weicker's help. Weicker argued that Conrail would relieve Amtrak's direct obligation to provide passenger services (1) by serving 15 miles of bankrupt track in the Northeast corridor of Amtrak. After the Department of Transportation threatened to withhold funds to Amtrak while the merger with Conrail was underway, Weicker would pressure the DOT with Senate Resolution 503. </p>
            <p>Weicker's success with Amtrak would later lead him to submit amendment 3405 (S. 2788) authorizing $600 million to purchase Conrail's securities. Later in 1987, a collision involving Conrail sparked Senate hearings. Conrail came under heavy fire after an operator, under the influence of drugs, killed 16 people in a crash. After hearings, a federal judge decided that Amtrak and Conrail would cover the damage claims arising from the collision. Conrail represents Amtrak's takeover of the potentially profitable lines of bankrupt carriers between 1976 and 1999.</p>

            <h5>House Joint Resolution 1288 - Railroad Study</h5>
            <p> In the early 1970s, Weicker introduced H.J. Res. 1288 in the House as a joint resolution to provide for a study of how feasible government acquisition, operation, and maintenance of railroad tracks, right of way, signal systems, other fixed facilities might be. Weicker’s hope was that the study would lay the groundwork for a coordinated federal transportation program. The resolution appropriated $100,000 for the study, conducted by the Secretary of Transportation. From this study, the federal government laid out the most feasible federal transportation program, and this eventually led to the creation of Amtrak.</p>
            <p class="sources">SOURCE: Railroads Box 10.</p>
            <h5>New Haven Railroad</h5>
            <p> During his time on the Transportation Committee, Weicker played a big role in public transportation. His role on the Committee would lead to the creation of Amtrak, the acquisition of Conrail, and New Haven Railroad. The New Haven railroad connected New Haven, CT, to New York City by both commuter, regional, and intercity rail. The Metro-North (commuter), Shoreline East (commuter), and Amtrak (regional and intercity) allowed Connecticut residents to commute to work in NYC in just under two hours. In 1984, Weicker requested that Amtrak consider scheduling rail services from Boston to New Haven using the inland route along the Connecticut Valley Line. This popular Connecticut line made Weicker popular not only with his own constituents but those in the Northeast corridor. While Amtrak wanted to cut the inland route due to funding, the New Haven line was saved by Weicker's efforts.</p>

            <h4>Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970</h4>
            <p> In 1970, the Rail Passenger Service Act (which would create Amtrak) was laid out on the floor of the Senate. From this piece of legislation, Weicker would go on to introduce House Joint Resolution 1288 (a call to fund a $100,000 study to see how feasibly the federal government could oversee a rail system), and in 1972, Weicker introduced HR 14419, a bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe rules, regulations, and performance and other standards as he finds necessary for all areas of railroad safety and to conduct rail safety research.</p>
            <p class="sources">SOURCE: Transportation Box 4.</p>
            <h5>S. 3343 Interstate Railroad Act of 1974</h5>
            <p> After the creation of Amtrak, funding became a huge issue. As Amtrak sought to cut lines in order to save money, Weicker introduced the Interstate Railroad Act of 1974 (S. 3343). With this bill, Amtrak could establish a national network of essential rail lines and require minimum maintenance on the lines. With upgrades and maintenance, the bill was designed to curb derailments on railways.</p>
            <p class="sources">SOURCE: Congressional Record, 4/10/1974.</p>
            <h5>Gas Rationing</h5>
            <p> In the 1970s, gas rationing became an American reality. In 1973, Weicker voted to modify the National Emergency Act Haskell-Chiles Amendment (S. 2585) to require the President to implement gasoline rationing and energy conservation measures. The amendment failed 40 to 48 (1). Weicker went on to introduce the Mandatory Gas Rationing Act of 1974 requiring the President to impose rationing within 30 days. Later, Weicker votes to recommit the Energy Emergency Act (S. 2589) after his dissatisfaction with the act's broad and permissive authority (1). </p>
            <p>In 1976, Weicker urged mandatory fuel conservation to lower demand and increase energy production, insisting that all Americans should have an equal share of the energy burden (1). By the end of the 1970s, Weicker introduced S.1449, establishing a mandatory gas ration plan (identical to the plan implemented by the Senate), except for its requirement to enact in 60 days. Finally, in 1980, Weicker added a comment about conservation to his report insisting that changes in foreign policy or throwing money at the energy problem would not be the miracle cure. Instead, &quot;changes in lifestyle...conservation, and when necessary, sacrifice, is the first step toward a responsible, honest, and effective energy policy.&quot; (2)</p>
            <p class="sources">SOURCES: (1) Osborn Box 23. (2) Osborn Box 6.</p>
            <h5>Gas Tax</h5>
            <p> The controversial gas tax became a tool Weicker used to promote energy conservation. Weicker began by pushing for a one-cent gas tax in 1985 and a nine-cent gas tax in 1980. In 1985 Weicker introduced a gas tax to ease the budget deficit and &quot;encourage conservation (1).&quot; At one point Weicker wanted to use gasoline tax to raise funds for Amtrak (2). While critics of the gas tax argued it would adversely affect the poor, cause inflation, and hurt the domestic auto industry because they do not have the mileage, Weicker argued it would be the easiest energy tax to implement, would be good for conservation, and would reduce oil imports. </p>
