          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>While in Congress, Weicker merged ocean policy, NOAA, and aquaculture with his responsibilities on the Commerce Committee. He paired a conservation approach with a research approach. Senator Weicker would oversee legislation surrounding oceanic issues such as oil drilling, regulation on ocean dumping, coastal changes, research, estuary programs, the sea grant programs, the fisherman’s contingency funds, and would even travel to Cuba in the name of oceanic and scientific research. Weicker’s contributions to ocean policy not only included environmental protection and research but stimulated economic productivity and development.</p>

          <h4>Oceans Advocacy</h4>
          <p> In 1975, Lowell Weicker made his first visit to the Hydro-lab in the Bahamas Islands. From this first exposure to the oceans and oceanic research, he became an advocate for the oceans. Senator Weicker and Representative Bill Alexander (D-AR) spent three days at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in a Hydro-lab cylinder with two NOAA scientists. Weicker met oceanic scientist Bob Wicklund, who would later become Weicker's legislative aide on oceans in 1976. Working primarily with Bob Wicklund, Weicker’s enthusiasm for the oceans carried over to the Senate, where he ensured funding and support for research as a member of the Commerce, and later Appropriations Committees. Wicklund played an essential role in guiding and advising Senator Weicker on his ocean policy initiatives even after leaving Weicker’s staff in 1982. Despite Wicklund’s departure, Weicker’s passion remained steadfast throughout the 1980s and even into his governorship in the 1990s. The oceans still continue to be an area of true and committed dedication for him. </p>
          <h4>NOAA</h4>
          <p> As part of his passion for the oceans, Lowell Weicker advocated for the development and expansion of aquaculture in the United States. Starting in 1976, Weicker pushed for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to include aquaculture as part of its national policy. Weicker later merged ocean policy, NOAA, and aquaculture with his responsibilities on the Commerce Committee throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. He campaigned for a more powerful and independent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association that could research, formulate, and implement policy for both air and water cleanliness and conservation. Weicker fought, unsuccessfully, to establish NOAA as an independent agency. While increased power was successfully delegated to NOAA, which in 1978 gained the ability to formulate oceanic pollution legislation through the Ocean Pollution Research and Development Monitoring Planning Act, the agency remains today, somewhat controversially, a part of the Department of Commerce.</p>
          <h4>Environmental Conservation</h4>
          <p> Weicker’s interest in oceans and conservation work appears to emanate from his work on the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. His interest in conservation and environmental legislation intensified in the 1970s as a result of gas shortages that bolstered his faith in public transportation as a long-term solution to both environmental and economic inequity problems in the United States. He subsequently sponsored a number of bills, including the successful Outer Continental Shelf Lands Amendments Act, in order to regulate offshore oil drilling.</p>
          <p>In the 1980s, Weicker and other Senators pledged to fund research for estuaries in the Northeast region. Specifically, Senators Weicker and Alfonse D'Amato (NY) repeatedly pushed Congress to support funding for research and monitoring of three New England estuaries, including the Long Island Sound. This accompanied legislation that dealt with the Clean Water Act and followed closely with Weicker’s advocacy for ocean research and fishing conservation.</p>
          <p>Senator Weicker’s commitment to oceanic and environmental legislation resulted in a number of successful pieces of legislation, including the Whale Preservation Act, the Marine Protection Act, and the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act.        </p>

            <h5>Alaskan Natural Wildlife Refuge</h5>
            <p> The Alaskan Natural Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) was an area of high contention in the late 1980s. After years of preservation, the ANWR came under controversy when the Reagan Administration wanted to open up the reserve to oil drilling and exploration. While Weicker addressed the issue in his last year as a Connecticut Senator (1987–88), it was a major energy issue for his Committee. When the Reagan Administration and NOAA wanted to &quot;open up America's wilderness … because of national security,&quot; many protested the government's action. </p>
            <p> In January 1987, Friends of the Earth representative Cynthia E. Wilson testified that opening up the 1002 area in ANWR would negatively impact the wildlife reserve and pointed out that reducing America's dependence on foreign oil would not be solved by opening up the domestic drilling site (1). Despite testimony from numerous opponents (Friends of the Earth, Defenders of Wildlife, Americans for Clean Air and Clean Water), NOAA pushed the states to streamline energy permits, encouraged domestic petroleum production, and removed government &quot;impediments&quot; to drilling in area 1002 in ANWR (2). By the end of the month, Secretary of the Interior Donald P. Hodel recommended opening up area 1002 to oil drilling while others decried that domestic drilling was &quot;not the answer to this country's energy woes.&quot; (3) </p>
            <p> When ANWR area 1002 came to vote in 1988, Weicker voted to open it up to oil drilling. Weicker, who was the swing vote in favor of the McClure amendment, shocked the conservationists because they did not see Weicker as “politically vulnerable to the oil industry.” (4). Opponents criticized Weicker for irreversibly destroying the nation's largest nature area, (3) and serving a &quot;blow to clear standards in conservation policy.”(4) Weicker admitted that drilling in area 1002 would &quot;not solve our energy problems,&quot; but also called for increases in vehicle fuel efficiency, funding for weatherization, and improving energy programs in public and private buildings (3). Oil drilling plans in area 1002 in ANWR came to a halt in 1989 with the Exxon Valdez spill off the coast of Alaska.</p>

            <h5>Aquaculture</h5>
            <p> Starting in 1976, Weicker pushed for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to include aquaculture as part of its national policy. In 1978 he spoke before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Technology on aquaculture legislation. The legislation, collectively called the &quot;National Aquaculture and Organic Act of 1978,&quot; called for greater recognition of aquaculture and the need for national ocean policy. While the 1978 legislation would be vetoed by President Jimmy Carter in October, President Ronald Reagan would sign the National Aquaculture Act into law in 1980. </p>

            <h5>Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act</h5>
            <p> In April 1979, the Subcommittee on Energy Conservation and Supply held hearings on the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (1). The act accelerated the program of environmental assessment, exploration, and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed, and ensured that such exploration was conducted in a manner that would encourage the conservation of such resources. In addition, the act encouraged the continued development of technology necessary to recover the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed (2). The Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (the Act) became responsible for issuing United States citizens licenses for the exploration for deep seabed hard minerals and one of the authorities of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (3). On June 28, 1980, the act would pass as PL 96-283. Today, the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resource Act serves to supervise and respond to mineral mining issues in the EEZ.</p>

            <h5>Fisherman Contingency Fund</h5>
            <p> In 1978, Congress passed the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Amendment Act (PL 95-372). As part of that act, Weicker co-sponsored the creation of the Fisherman's Contingency Fund. Due to the advent of underwater oil drilling, many fishermen struggled to maintain their own equipment because it often became tangled up with the oil equipment. Under this amendment, the federal government would now reimburse fishermen whose gear was damaged on underwater oil drilling equipment, providing them with the resources to replace and/or repair damaged equipment.</p>

            <h5>Iroquois Pipeline</h5>
            <p> In 1988, the Iroquois natural gas pipeline was proposed to cross Connecticut land in order to bring natural gas to certain portions of the Northeast from Canada (1). Weicker's staffer, Tim Osborn, recommended that Weicker demand that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) delay the accelerated review and application for the Iroquois pipeline. Weicker proceeded to ask about the FERC budget and application process and take a neutral stance on the bidding system for applications. When the proposal for the pipeline came before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Weicker insisted that the pipeline undergo a complete review before any federal work was done. FERC chairman Martha Hesse had planned to accelerate the review for the Iroquois pipeline, but Weicker wanted “full public input” and asserted that, “energy regulation must [have] credibility and…never be tainted by secrecy.” FERC agrees to Weicker’s demands (2).</p>

            <h5>Ixtoc Oil Spill</h5>
            <p> In 1979, an oil well in the Gulf of Mexico exploded, causing the biggest oil spill disaster up to that date (1). The Ixtoc oil spill (also known as the Campeche oil spill) of 1979 became a major environmental crisis as the Mexican government tried to cover up the extent of the damage and claim the situation was under control. Weicker sent his oceanic expert Robert Wicklund down to Mexico to survey the damage and investigate the cleanup and regulation of the oil spill (2). As Wicklund flew over the site of the oil spill, he saw &quot;oil just blasting up out of the sea on fire (3).&quot; Wicklund reported his findings back to Weicker, citing that the oil spill was in no way under control, and Weicker &quot;made a lot of noise&quot; about the Mexican government's lack of communication and attempted cover up of the oil spill (4,5). Wicklund argued that Mexico's offshore drilling technology was neither safe nor sophisticated enough to handle the oil spill and its cleanup. Following Wicklund’s report, Weicker instigated congressional hearings before the Senate Energy Resources and Materials Production Subcommittee (of which Weicker was a ranking minority member) (6).</p>

            <h5>Long Island Sound</h5>
            <p> Research on Long Island Sound took place due to the efforts of Senators Weicker and Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) under the estuaries funding (1). In 1980, Weicker argued and passed a new amendment that would alter the Marine Protection Act. His amendment would extend the act's funding to include research and toxicity testing in the Long Island Sound and other Connecticut marinas (2). Later in 1982, Weicker would co-sponsor a bill that would open up an underwater waste disposal site in Long Island Sound, arguing that the harbors were clogged without the new site (3). Pollution was also a major concern of Weicker's, and in 1984 he and Senator D'Amato introduced an amendment to the 1985 Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill called the Weicker-D'Amato Long Island Sound Amendment to address the issues of pollution in three major New England estuaries (1). The amendment passes, and in 1985, the federal government conducted pollution studies in the Long Island Sound (4).</p>

            <h5>Marine Migratory Fish Conservation and Study Act</h5>
            <p> In 1976, Congress passed The Fishery Conservation and Management Act (the &quot;200-mile law&quot; establishing the EEZ). With this bill, fishermen were better able to compete with foreign fisheries. The U.S. established a 200-mile zone that only allowed U.S. fishermen to fish and established the regional fishery management council (1,2). This law, however, did not cover migratory fish in its authority. As such, Weicker introduced the Marine Migratory Fish Conservation and Study Act to Congress on October 31, 1977. With this legislation, NOAA gained authority to manage migratory fish not originally included in previous legislation (2).</p>

            <h5>National Aquaculture and Organic Act of 1978</h5>
            <p> In April 1978, Senator Weicker made a statement before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Technology on aquaculture legislation. The legislation, a combination of HR. 9370, S. 2582, and S. 2762, was collectively called the &quot;National Aquaculture and Organic Act of 1978.&quot; Weicker pressed for greater recognition of aquaculture and the need for national ocean policy. In October 1978, President Jimmy Carter vetoed the legislation, citing that federal programs already exist that address the technology and could adequately address ocean policies. In 1980, the series of bills would pass as the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 (PL 96-362).</p>

            <h5>Nuclear Policy</h5>
            <p> During his time on the Energy Committee in the 1980s, Senator Lowell Weicker supported the use of nuclear energy, but also supported liability legislation such as the Price-Anderson Act in 1986. In November 1985, Weicker voted with the Committee to amend the Low Level Radiation Water Policy Act of 1980, which would authorize assistance to the Department of Energy to regional low-level waste compact regions and review guidelines for radioactive waste (1). While serving on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Weicker attended hearings on the Price-Anderson Act. This act would set up a “comprehensive compensation oriented system of liability insurance for Department of Energy contractors and nuclear regulatory commission licenses.” The Act intended to assure the public of compensation in the case of nuclear accident, but also set a limit on nuclear liability. In October 1986 Weicker voted in support of the re-authorization and extension of the Price-Anderson Act (S. 748). S. 748 would provide funds to pay off injuries involving nuclear materials. However, in 1986 Weicker voted against S.1225 (The Nuclear Definition Bill) on the basis that insurance companies could never cover the costs of Chernobyl-like nuclear disasters (1).</p>

            <h5>Ocean Dumping Act</h5>
            <p> In 1972, Congress passed the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (the Ocean Dumping Act). This law would prohibit and monitor ocean waste dumping and establish sanctuaries for conservation and protection of marine life (1). When the act became law (PL 92-532), Congress became responsible for regulating the dumping of all materials into ocean water and preventing and limiting dumping of any materials that would affect human health or the marine environment (2).</p>

            <h5>Offshore Oil Drilling</h5>
            <p> In December 1979, the first sale of oil rights in Georges Bank occurred (1), and by February 1980, Weicker began holding hearings on the impact of offshore oil and gas development on Georges Bank (2). From these hearings came the Georges Bank Protection Act that passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee (2). When the Department of Interior released plans to open up nearly the entire U.S. coastline to oil and gas drilling, Weicker expressed his displeasure with the plan (2). Secretary of the Interior James Watt faced numerous lawsuits by state and environment groups aimed to stop the oil-lease plan through 1982 and 1983 (3). Congress followed the lawsuits with amendments of its own. </p>
            <p> In August 1982, Weicker drafted an amendment to stop the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) plan. In September Weicker held hearings with Secretary Watts, and later introduced amendments against Watt's wishes. By October 1983, Watts resigned as Secretary of Interior (4). As such, Weicker helped in diminishing the impact of the DOI's five-year Outer Continental Shelf plan (2). Today, Weicker admits his support for offshore drilling, so long as the oil drillers have the plan, resources, and ability to resolve any oil pollution issue (especially oil spills).</p>

            <h5>S. 1567 The Regulatory Fairness Act</h5>
            <p> In 1987 Senator Weicker co-sponsored a bill with Senator Bumpers (D-AR) and with 12 others to allow FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) to order &quot;refunds to be made back to electric ratepayers that have been charged excessive or unjust rates by utility companies.&quot; The Regulatory Fairness Act (S. 1567) amended the federal power to serve the consumer and utility alike in considering rate reductions and increases and allow FERC to set a refund effective date. Weicker specifically spoke on the bill on November 18, 1987 to the Energy Committee, and by March 1988 the Senate Committee/Subcommittee voted favorably on the bill.</p>

            <h5>S. 1668</h5>
            <p> In April 1973, Weicker introduced S.1668 to the Senate. S.1668 was a bill to amend the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) of 1969 to ensure environmental considerations were balanced with economic and social considerations. While speaking on the Senate floor, Weicker argued for the broadening of the definition of &quot;environment&quot; to include &quot;all costs to human environment.&quot; NEPA became the first major piece of environmental legislation that required environmental impact reports prior to government actions.</p>

            <h5>S. 2167 The National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988</h5>
            <p> The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act included several pieces of federal legislation that governed efficiency standards for household appliances in the 1980s (1). In 1986, Weicker voted to support H.R.5465 which would become law in 1987. This legislation provided guidelines to update efficiency standards in clothes dryers, refrigerators, etc. (2). On March 14, 1988, Weicker introduced S.2167, The National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, to propose an industry-wide change- over to fluorescent lamp ballasts in household appliances as part of new conservation standards. Under this piece of legislation, Congress established minimum energy efficiency standards for many major appliances (3).</p>

            <h5>S. 2285</h5>
            <p>S. 2285, a bill to enhance undersea science and technology capabilities, is one of the first ocean initiatives Weicker introduced in the Commerce Committee. A huge advocate for the oceans after his trip in 1976, he pushes for increased funding into ocean protection and ocean research. As a member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Weicker oversaw funding for the Hydro-lab and marine research.</p>
            <h5>S. 801 - The Coal Slurry Pipeline</h5>
            <p> The Coal Slurry Pipeline was a project to build a 3,712-foot pipeline across a federal right-of-way, bringing “substantially larger supplies of natural gas” to the New England area in the winter (1). In November 1981, Weicker agreed to co-sponsor S.R. 232, endorsing existing energy conservation tax credits. Weicker, along with Senator Johnston, voted via proxy to waive the 60-day waiting period for the Texas Eastern Transmission company to build the pipeline across the federal right-of-way (1). In April 1985, Weicker's aide, Tim Osborn, received information regarding the coal slurry pipeline, including a report stipulating the reduced cost of railroads by the pipeline and the line's impact on markets (2). Supporters claimed the pipeline would decrease the costs of railroad transportation and impact the coal markets of the Northeast (2). <span class="work-title">The New York Times</span> reported Senator Johnston invited Weicker to cosponsor the bill to grant eminent domain authority to the construction of the pipeline. Tim Osborn recommended Weicker support the bill, regardless of the railroad opposition. Going against his staff's recommendation, Weicker refused to co-sponsor the bill even if strict standards were met (1).</p>

            <h5>Sea Grant Awards</h5>
            <p> The National Sea Grant Program is a NOAA-run, government-funded program that gives out money to universities for ocean research. In 1982, Lowell Weicker introduced the Marine Resource Management and Resource Act to earmark $300 million per year for programs like coastal zone management, fishery research, and fish stock development. When Weicker became the chairman of the Subcommittee of Commerce, Wicklund credits him with &quot;basically saving&quot; the Sea Grant program with $57 million dollars a year. Today, the Sea Grant program has offices in 30 coastal states and provides the funds and opportunity for universities to take part in ocean research. </p>

            <h5>Superfund</h5>
            <p> In the wake of toxic waste dumps like Love Canal and Times Beach in the 1970s, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), otherwise known as the Superfund Act. This fund is a federal government program to clean up the nation's uncontrolled hazardous waste sites through the EPA. In addition, the Superfund requires the responsible parties to perform the cleanup and reimburse the government for their cleanup efforts (1). Weicker first encountered the Superfund in December 1980. While he had little personal interest in the bill, many constituents urged him to support the Superfund and its amendments. As such, the Superfund and Weicker's sponsorship of the bill became a campaign talking point (2).</p>

            <h5>The Price-Anderson Act</h5>
            <p> The Price-Anderson Act established liability and indemnification for nuclear incidents arising out of federal storage, disposal, or related transportation of high-level radioactive material. From its conception in May 1985, Weicker was a supporter of the S.2524, the Price-Anderson Act (1). In 1986, Weicker votes to reauthorize and extend the Price-Anderson Act in S.748 (a bill that would provide funds to pay off injuries involving nuclear materials) (2). </p>

            <h5>United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty</h5>
            <p> The United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty is an international agreement that seeks to define the nation's rights and responsibilities regarding the ocean. The agreement consists of five major areas: marine biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction, ocean noise, ecosystem approaches, oceans and climate change, and piracy. Beginning in 1973, the treaty aims to normalize oceanic law through the U.N., but many U.S. legislators have had little interest in ceding sovereignty to an international committee, and still today, the U.S. has not signed onto the United Law of the Sea Treaty. Bob Wicklund suggests the U.S. has not signed on due to conflicts with the mining and oil industries, but he and Weicker continue to urge U.S. participation.</p>

            <h5>Visit to Cuba</h5>
            <p> After consulting with the State Department, Lowell Weicker received permission to take members of his staff to meet and talk with Fidel Castro. In October 1980 Weicker made his first visit to Cuba for a week to discuss fisheries, conservation, and marine science (1). According to Bob Wicklund, the goal of this visit was to establish scientific communication between Cuba and the United States. Weicker believed that regardless of other issues, the United States and Cuba should be able to at least work together on science. While on the island, Bob Wicklund and Lowell Weicker toured the milk production factories, discussed Cuba's fishing industry, and the protection of sea turtles. </p>
            <p> As a result of this first visit, Fidel Castro and Lowell Weicker agreed to a cooperative science program that would bring teams from Cuba and the United States to the islands of St. Croix and the Virgin Islands to dive together on the Hydro-lab. The goal of the trip was to begin a scientific exchange between the two nations, but with Ronald Reagan in the presidency, restrictions between Cuba and the United States tightened up (2).</p>

            <h5>Exclusive Economic Zone</h5>
            <p>The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is referred to as the &quot;200-mile law&quot; because it extends U.S. coastal borders by 200 miles. In 1976, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act passed Congress. With this act, the U.S. expanded its territory of U.S. waters by 200 miles, allowing fishermen to better compete with foreign fisheries (1,2). From this act in 1976, the Economic Exclusive Zone became one of NOAA's biggest responsibilities (3). International legislation concerning the EEZ was a part of the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea treaty. After a ten-year negotiating effort, the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea was concluded. </p>
            <p> The Convention accomplished many of the objectives of U.S. ocean policy, such as a 12-mile breadth for the territorial sea, and the 200-mile exclusive economic zone. With these agreements, international law would allow for freedom of passage in straits, exclusive economic zones, and archipelagos. This far-reaching environmental accord fully supported U.S. interests in commercial navigation, military movement, leasing policy over mineral resources on the continental shelf, and diverse fisheries management issues, but has yet to be signed by the United States (4,5). </p>
            <p>In 1983, President Ronald Reagan placed NOAA in charged of the EEZ, doubling NOAA's jurisdiction (6). The President's proclamation on March 10, 1983, claimed sovereign rights and jurisdiction within the Exclusive Economic Zone, extending 200 nautical miles seaward from the coast of the United States and U.S. territories. In joining the majority of coastal nations in declaring a 200-mile EEZ, the United States was left with the question of establishing a minerals management regime for the area. The Department of the Interior (DOI) asserted the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act as a suitable mechanism. </p>
            <p>Legislative authority for managing mineral resources within the EEZ is somewhat unclear. Two laws could be brought to apply: the OCS Lands Act (under which the DOI has jurisdiction over the leasing of minerals on the continental shelf), and the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (under which NOAA has jurisdiction). While either of these two acts could be utilized to accommodate development of mineral resources within the EEZ, each serves best its specific purpose (7).</p>
