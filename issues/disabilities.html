          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>During the 1980s, Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., and his staff evaluated, updated, and created health policies in the field of mental disabilities and civil rights for people with disabilities. Senator Weicker is a long-standing and very vocal advocate of affordable public programs for people with disabilities, a commitment fostered by his son, Sonny, who has Down’s syndrome. As President Reagan sought to scale back federal aid for health care, welfare, and education, Senator Weicker and his staff fought back against deep budget cuts, ensuring that legislation would continue to serve the needs of disabled individuals.</p>

          <h4>Staff Investigations of State Institutions</h4>
          <p>De-institutionalization was the predominant trend that characterized health care for people with mental disabilities in the 1980s. Until the late 1960s, people with mental disabilities were frequently placed in state institutions. By the 1980s federal action became more and more necessary as many states were shielding their own institutions from allegations of abuse. Senator Lowell Weicker’s staff led the investigations of these state institutions across the country. Weicker staff members Maureen Byrnes, Steven Snider, and Terry Muilenburg visited numerous facilities and organized the report for the Committee. Their investigations culminated in the passage of protection and advocacy legislation, and eventually the Americans with Disabilities Act. </p>
          <h4>Position on Health and Human Services</h4>
          <p>When Republicans took over the majority in Congress, Senator Weicker moved from ranking to chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Appropriations Subcommittee in 1981 and 1983, respectively. When he was appointed Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education 1983, he secured the first budget for domestic and social programs in five years. In 1984, Weicker chaired a hearing to review the Justice Department’s record on enforcing the civil rights of institutionalized individuals with mental disabilities. During the 1980s, Senator Weicker’s position as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on the Handicapped played a vital role in fighting budget cuts and establishing a new national policy on treatment of people with disabilities. He introduced and co-sponsored numerous bills on the Senate floor, working closely with both Republicans and Democrats. </p>
          <p>Senator Weicker also became an outspoken critic of Ronald Reagan’s attempts to decrease funding for social welfare and education programs in the 1980s. During the Reagan Administration, funding for social programs dramatically decreased, and Weicker and his staff fought back against the budget cuts. Weicker knew the importance of providing services to people with mental disabilities and mental illnesses. In one of the most heated debates over budget cuts, Weicker refused to remove funds from schizophrenia treatment just to allocate those funds to another department. Weicker refused to &quot;rob Peter to pay Paul&quot; during budget cuts. Instead, he continued to send back revised budgets to the President. While cuts had to be made in the 1980s, Weicker and his staff ensured that mental health services would continue to have funding.</p>
<h4>Education</h4>
          <p>In a time of fiscal and social conservatism, Weicker managed to increase funding for a number of programs and areas in which Reagan proposed cuts. He also criticized Secretary of Education William J. Bennett’s attempted appointment of Dr. Eileen M. Gardner to his staff, arguing that her opinions on education for people with disabilities made her unqualified to be employed in the Department of Education. She subsequently withdrew her name. </p>
          <p>After losing his reelection battle in 1988, Senator Weicker left the Senate before the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed. Nevertheless, he is remembered as the “father” of the ADA, an advocate for people with mental disabilities, and a legislator who often worked independently to further the advancement of people with disabilities.</p>

          <h5>Americans with Disabilities Act</h5>
          <p>In 1988 Weicker introduced S. 2345, which would become the Americans with Disabilities Act (passed in 1990). The bill had much stronger language and much broader civil rights policies than the act that was eventually passed into law. After losing his reelection battle in 1988, Weicker left the Senate before the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed. Nevertheless, he is remembered as an advocate for people with mental disabilities and a legislator who often worked independently and without the apparent endorsement of his own party. In 1990, President Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act, an expansive civil rights bill, heralding yet another turning point in legislation for people with mental disabilities. Notably, Weicker introduced the Senate legislation that ultimately led to this law in 1988.</p>

          <h5>CRIPA</h5>
          <p>The Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of 1980 authorizes the Attorney General to seek relief for persons confined in public institutions where conditions exist that deprive residents of their constitutional rights.</p>
          <h5>Education for All Handicapped Children Act (1975-1986)</h5>
          <p>In 1975 the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA) or Public Law (PL) 94-142 passed with a Senate vote 83-10. Senator Weicker voted for the act, which provides $6 billion over four years to ensure the right to education for all children with disabilities (<span class="work-title">Congressional Record</span>, 7/18/1975; <span class="work-title">New York Times</span>, 11/06/1975). In the 1980s, President Reagan signed the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act. It combined funding into a single block grant to local school districts. Because the block grant did not require a school district to spend funds on a specific program, it left special education very vulnerable. In 1983, the Education of Handicapped Amendments were signed into law, providing federal assistance to states in giving children with disabilities free public education. They also required “mainstreaming” (education alongside children without disabilities) for children with disabilities. The Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986 (S.2294) were introduced in April.</p>

          <h5>Public Witness Testimony</h5>
          <p>During the budget cuts for mental health services in the 1980s, Public Witness Testimony allowed citizens from across the country to come in and request funding for particular programs, types of treatment, or breakthrough studies. The testimony became especially important in deciding who most needed funding from the federal government. Public witness testimony hearings were always heavily attended. However, only a small number of requests could be fulfilled.</p>

          <h5>S. 1855 Health Planning and Resource Allocation Act of 1986</h5>
          <p>This piece of legislation directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants (based on population) to states for health planning and resource allocation. States could use funds for any of the following reasons: 1) studies regarding the financing and delivery of health care in the state; 2) local plans for the allocation of health services and resources; 3) establishment of certificate of need programs; and 4) assessments of access to health services. Mental health facilities were not covered under these provisions and health insurances.</p>

          <h5>S. 1948 Quality Services for Disabled Individuals Act of 1985</h5>
          <p>In 1985 Senator Lowell Weicker, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on the Handicapped, introduced the Quality Services for Disabled Individuals Act. The bill required states to provide home and community-based services as a condition of participation in the Medicaid program. S. 1948 established a new Bureau of Quality Services and radically increased the role of the federal government in certification of residential facilities. </p>
          <p> Although the bill was significantly different from S. 973, Senator Chafee's Community and Family Living Amendments put new pressure on the Finance Committee to take a serious look at the ICF/MR program. The bill, passed by Congress in 1985, would ensure quality services to people with developmental disabilities and mentally illnesses in institutions, hospitals, and communities. Provisions in the bill required individualized rehabilitation plans that were aimed at increasing client independence and established standards for determining an individual's placement. </p>
          <p>Weicker’s bill would also overhaul the survey, certification, and monitoring systems for institutions, which would virtually eliminate the existing state self-certification conflict of interest. New certification standards would be developed and uniform training of surveyors would be provided. Such activities would be administered by a newly created disability bureau within the Health Care Financing Administration, assigned to monitor Medicaid and Medicare disability programs. Finally, the Weicker bill provided incentives for states to expand community-based services by establishing the community waiver as a permanent part of the Medicaid program.</p>

          <h5>S. 2294 - The Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986</h5>
          <p>In April of 1986, Weicker introduced The Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments. This legislation sought to amend and extend the provisions of the Education of the Handicapped Children's Act (S. 2294), also introduced by Weicker. The bill appropriates a $200 million initiative in early education for children with disabilities (ages birth to five) and consists of two sections. The first created a new state grant program to enhance services for handicapped children. This bill had wide support. Each state was to develop a plan of how they would serve children with disabilities (age birth to 2). S. 2294 made it clear that early intervention in the form of special education services, social services, health services, and hospitalization were essential to the success of children with disabilities. The second part of the initiative was an amendment requiring all states to provide special education (and all related services) to children between age 3 and 5. In addition to reauthorizing grant programs for three more years, the bill raised the 12 percent ceiling (set by P.L. 94-142) on the number of children with disabilities a state may serve. S. 2294 became law in October of 1986.</p>

          <h5>S. 415 Handicapped Children’s Protection Act</h5>
          <p>After the <span class="court-case">Smith vs. Robinson</span> court case (1984), parents of children with mental disabilities were guaranteed public education for their sons or daughters. As a result of this case, Weicker introduced the Handicapped Children's Protection Act (S. 415) in February of 1985. This bill would provide funds to parents who successfully challenged a school district for failing to provide education to their child. In August of 1985, President Ronald Reagan signed the Handicapped Children's Protection Act into law as PL 99-372. Today, Weicker considers this one of the major pieces of legislation dealing with disabilities.</p>
          <p class="sources">Sources: Leslie Francis and Anita Silvers. Americans with Disabilities. (New York: Routledge, 2000) pg. 295. Interview, Maureen Byrnes.</p>
          <h5>S. 974 Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Persons Act</h5>
          <p>The Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Persons Act was one of the first pieces of legislation guaranteeing protection and rights for people with mental illness. In the mid-1980s, Weicker’s staff (Maureen Byrnes, Steve Snider, and Terry Muilenberg) investigated over 30 mental health facilities across the U.S. Their report not only exposed the abuses and inadequacies of mental health facilities, but proposed ways of improving services to people with mental illness. From this staff report, Weicker introduced S. 974 to the Senate and it passed into law. Under this piece of legislation, the federal government set up advocacy agencies for residents of the facilities and enacted new standards of conduct.          </p>
          <h5 class="court-case">Smith vs. Robinson</h5>
          <p>The Supreme Court case <span class="court-case">Smith vs. Robinson</span> established that parents cannot be refunded fees paid to attorneys when challenging their child’s education plan in public schools, narrowing application of the due process clause for litigation involving individuals with disabilities. Because of this Supreme Court case, Weicker introduced the Handicapped Children's Protection Act (S. 415) to ensure attorneys' fees would be covered if parents successfully challenged school districts. </p>
          <h5>Staff Report</h5>
          <p>In the mid-1980s, Weicker’s staff spent a great deal of time touring mental health facilities throughout the country, amassing a huge amount of information on facility statistics, residents, and staff, as well as documenting allegations of abuse and neglect. Steve Snider was the staffer in charge of these investigations, assisted by Maureen Byrnes, Robert Wilson, Terry Muilenburg, and Jane West. Most visits took place between 1984 and 1985, and a total of over 30 institutions were toured. The Southbury Training School and Mansfield Training School, both in Connecticut, were especially relevant to Weicker since they were located within his home state and were both deemed substandard in terms of care for residents with disabilities. Weicker used the information his staffers gathered to argue for more protection for people with disabilities as well as for an increased emphasis on deinstitutionalization, holding hearings soon after the investigations were through. Though he met with criticism from his own constituents as well as others across the nation, he worked tirelessly to increase funding and resources for home- and community-based centers.</p>
          <p class="sources">Sources: Maureen Byrnes interview.</p>
          <h5>Vocational Rehabilitation Act</h5>
          <p>Senator Weicker’s involvement with the Vocational Rehabilitation Act began in 1973 when he voted to override then President Nixon’s veto. The 1973 act would have provided $2.6 billion for rehabilitation services and expansion of assistance to people with disabilities, but the veto would be sustained in the Senate (Congressional Record, 4/03/1973). Congress would eventually authorize and pass the Vocation Education Act Amendments of 1976. In 1982, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) introduced the Vocational and Adult Education Act (S. 2325), which would have consolidated and simplified federal programs in vocational aid and adult education. (Congressional Record, 3/31/1982). </p>
          <p> In 1983, Executive Director of the American Vocational Association, Dr. Gene Bottoms, worked to help draft legislation to reauthorize the Vocation Education Act Amendments of 1976 (Congressional Record, 2/23/1983). Action on this bill would not be taken until 1984. In February, Senator Robert Stafford (R-VT) and Senator Weicker co-sponsored the Vocational Educational Reauthorization Bill, which would assist the states in insuring that those who were inadequately served under the previous vocational education programs would have access to quality vocational education programs (Congressional Record, 2/08/1984). Under the rehabilitation act, the term “disabled individual” is defined as “any person who 1) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person’s major life activities, 2) has a record of such impairment, or 3) is regarded as having such an impairment,” and this definition is closely related to the Americans with Disabilities Act. This definition is also used to define individuals who qualify as having a disability and who can be considered in affirmative action programs.</p>

          <h5><span class="court-case">Youngberg vs. Romeo</span> (1982)</h5>
          <p>This Supreme Court decision ruled that institutionalized residents had the right to safety, protection from harm, and freedom from undue restraint. It was the first case to establish the constitutional right of protection for people with mental disabilities. It did, however, rely on professional judgment of private doctors to deem what qualified as “harm, undue restraint,” etc. Senator Weicker wrote an amicus curiae brief in support of the respondent Romeo. Later, Weicker would use this court decision as the basis for his investigation into state mental health facilities and the passage of S. 415 and S. 974.</p>
