          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>Lowell Weicker is largely known today because of his involvement in the Watergate hearings, and is particularly lauded for what some call an independent investigation, which ran ahead of the official Watergate Committee. On February 8, 1973, Senator Lowell P. Weicker was officially appointed to the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities. A junior Senator from Connecticut, Weicker soon earned a reputation for being outspoken in his refusal to allow higher-ups in the Nixon Administration to evade responsibility for the Watergate break-ins and the consequent Senate investigation into an administration cover-up.</p>

          <h4>Watergate Investigations</h4>
          <p> Senator Weicker publicly devoted himself to identifying the true culprits of Watergate, regardless of their party affiliation. Though he supported Nixon’s 1968 campaign, Weicker became increasingly critical of the President’s political style, tactics, negative campaigning, and secrecy that characterized Nixon’s campaign for reelection. As one of three Republicans on the Select Committee, Weicker often faced criticism from conservative Republicans for his attacks on the Nixon Administration. </p>
          <p>Weicker launched an independent investigation, referred to in news reports as the “third front,” in March 1973. His contacts with a number of Republicans, including Pat Gray, and with reporters allowed him access to private documents and conversations that fueled his beliefs that top members of Nixon’s team were involved in the break-ins. The Senate Hearings Testimony, which began on May 17, 1973, and ended on August 7, 1973, called numerous White House staffers and key witnesses of the Watergate scandal to the stand. The most influential to the Committee’s and Weicker's investigation included John Dean, H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, Alexander Butterfield, and John Mitchell. Weicker often angered Nixon officials who were brought in for interviews, including Ehrlichman and Haldeman. </p>
          <p>Weicker became increasingly visible on camera and in news reports through 1973 as he continued to press for a more thorough and exhaustive investigation. On at least three occasions, Weicker received phone calls from angry Republicans asking whether or not he planned on switching to the Democratic Party. Additionally, false reports of illegal campaign activities during Weicker’s 1970 run for Senate were purportedly called in to reporters in a failed attempt to discredit the Senator.</p>
          <p>As much as he was critical of the Nixon Administration and various officials involved in Watergate, the Senator was sympathetic towards certain individuals he believed had fallen victim to a greater conspiracy. He believed Gray and John Dean, among others, were being sacrificed by men like Colson, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman. Weicker met with the four Cuban Americans who were arrested after breaking into the Watergate Hotel, and following the meeting became convinced that they did not deserve the punishment that was given them.</p>
          <h4>Watergate Outcomes</h4>
          <p> As part of his independent investigation, Weicker explored President Nixon’s tax records from 1968–72, arguing that Nixon had illegally categorized his presidential papers as tax-deductible “gifts” to the National Archives. Weicker viewed this tax fraud as the final nail in Nixon’s political coffin, giving his discovery great weight in his 1995 autobiography Maverick. The tax fraud compounded concerns over campaign finance abuses, leading Weicker to pursue campaign finance reform bills in the Senate during the 1970s. As part of his investigation and a marker of support for campaign finance transparency, Weicker made his own tax records publicly available and, after false reports of improper campaigning in 1970, was cleared of all charges in 1975.</p>
          <p>Lowell Weicker is remembered during the Watergate years as an unwavering, dogged, and outspoken proponent of a full, broad investigation of the entire Nixon Administration, despite his Republican Party affiliations. He received criticism for grandstanding and for stepping out of place on numerous occasions, but most attributed the success of Watergate at least in part to Senator Weicker’s willingness to single-mindedly pursue issues and leads as an independent.        </p>

            <h5>CRP (CREEP)</h5>
            <p> The Committee to Re-Elect the President (CRP) devised the strategy, funds, and execution of the Watergate scandal. The committee, also known as CREEP, became the catalyst of the Watergate controversy when it used funds to pay the legal expenses of the five Watergate burglars in exchange for their silence and perjured testimony. CRP served as a special presidential committee under President Nixon. President Nixon's own committee was therefore responsible for the Watergate break-in and cover-up. Due to his involvement, President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974. Those serving on the committee, including John Mitchell and Gordon Liddy, were interviewed in the Senate hearings. The members' connections with H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman led Senator Weicker to call for their resignations.</p>
            <h5>John Dean</h5>
            <p> John Dean served as counsel to President Nixon from June 1970 to April 30, 1973, when he was fired for his involvement in the Watergate scandal. While serving as counsel to the President, Dean was highly involved in the events leading up to the Watergate break-in and the cover-up. Dean, H.R. Haldeman, and John Ehrlichman were President Nixon's closest advisors. While John Dean's initial investigation of the Watergate scandal reported the White House was not involved, further investigation by Weicker's Watergate Committee would reveal that the three advisors met with President Nixon to organize the break-in, discuss the pay-offs for the perjured testimony, and discuss the handling of the cover-up. After President Nixon fired John Dean, Dean, because of his involvement, became a key witness for the prosecution. </p>
            <p> Senator Lowell Weicker, a neighbor of John Dean in Alexandria, Virginia, met privately with Dean outside of the formal committee. After months of stonewalling, Dean finally “synopsized everything&quot; about the Watergate scandal to Weicker and his staffers (Weicker). John Dean would later go on to testify before a formal committee about the details of the Watergate scandal: Ehrlichman's ordering the destruction of implicating documents, the FBI's involvement in CRP activities, and President Nixon's involvement in the Watergate scandal. As the Watergate hearings and controversy came to a close, Weicker personally sought to ease John Dean's sentence because of their close relationship and the valuable role Dean played in the Watergate hearings (Watergate Box 7).</p>

            <h5>S. 1189</h5>
            <p> As a part of the Watergate reform legislation, Weicker was instrumental in the creation and passage of S. 1189, the &quot;Federal Election Campaign Reform Act.&quot; In 1974, Weicker introduced amendments to the 1971 law that established the FEC (Federal Election Commission) to enforce the law, facilitate disclosure, and administer the public funding program. On March 13, 1974, Weicker successfully introduced the amendment, and later the Senate approved and passed the reform act. Later that year, President Gerald Ford vetoed the campaign finance reform legislation. The Senate, however, would override the President and put the Federal Election Campaign Reform Act on the books. S. 1189 established the following: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> FEC would enforce laws regarding campaign finance and donation </li>
              <li>limited contributions to candidates for federal office </li>
              <li>required disclosure of political contributions </li>
              <li>provided for the public financing of presidential elections </li>
              <li>limited expenditures by candidates and associated committees (except for presidential candidates who accept public funding) </li>
              <li>limited independent expenditures to $1,000 </li>
              <li>limited candidate expenditures from personal funds </li>
              <li>created and fixed the method of appointing members to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) </li>
            </ul>
<p>While the reform act passed in 1974, the FEC was not in effect until 1975 and administered its first oversight responsibilities in the presidential election of 1976. S. 1189 was a controversial amendment, and in 1976, the Supreme Court in Buckley vs. Valeo struck down or narrowed numerous provisions of the bill, including the limits on spending and personal funds used for a candidate's campaign.</p>

            <h5>Senate Hearings</h5>
            <p> The Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities investigated the Watergate break-in starting in 1973. As one of three Republicans on the Committee, Weicker faced harsh criticism from conservative Republicans. He claimed his intense investigation into the Watergate scandal was not intended to ruin the Republican Party, but to save it. From February 1973 until the impeachment hearings began in May of 1974, the Senate investigation committee conducted numerous interviews with Presidential staff members, CRP members, and secretaries. During the hearings, dramatic moments included testimony from Alexander Butterfield, John Dean, H.R. Haldeman, and John Ehrlichman. At the end of the Committee's time, the investigation revealed the White House's involvement in the Watergate break-in. The exposure of Nixon's involvement in the break-in and cover up led to his resignation in 1974.</p>
            <h5>Watergate Reform Legislation – Campaign Finance</h5>
            <p> Following the investigation into Nixon's campaign activities, the GAO (Government Accountability Office) launched an investigation on campaign contributions (Franklin). In October 1973, Weicker released 21 memos that documented the use of government agencies to investigate Nixon's opponents during his 1970 campaign for reelection. The Watergate committee uncovered Nixon's investigation into campaign contributions to his opponents. Senator Weicker was instrumental in making all banking records confidential and mandating the notification of bank record investigations. In July 1974, the Senate approved Weicker's amendments regarding the confidentiality of banking records (1). The IRS was now under obligation to notify people under investigation (2). </p>
            <p>Following the Watergate hearings, Weicker explored President Nixon’s tax records from 1968-72, arguing that Nixon had illegally categorized his presidential papers as tax-deductible “gifts” to the National Archives. Weicker viewed this tax fraud as the final nail in Nixon’s political coffin, giving his discovery great weight in his 1995 autobiography Maverick. The tax fraud compounded concerns over campaign finance abuses, leading Weicker to pursue campaign finance reform bills in the Senate during the 1970s. After false reports of illegal campaign activities during Weicker's 1970 run for Senate, Weicker made his own tax records publicly available to clear up any doubts and demonstrate his personal support for campaign finance transparency. Following Weicker's tax disclosure, Archibald Cox cleared Weicker of any improper campaign allegations in 1975 (Hartford).</p>

            <h5>Weicker's Independent Investigation</h5>
            <p> Lowell Weicker's legacy during the Watergate years stems from his thorough, broad investigation of the entire Nixon Administration, despite his Republican affiliations. Republican party members repeatedly labeled Weicker as a grandstander and repeatedly criticized Weicker for stepping out of place. Moreover, most political analysts attribute the success of the Watergate hearings at least in part to Senator Weicker's willingness to single-handedly pursue leads and issues as an independent. Weicker often angered Nixon officials who were brought in for interviews, including John Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman. </p>
            <p>Shortly after the formation of the Watergate Investigation Committee, Weicker launched an independent investigation. His contacts with a number of Republicans, including Pat Gray, and with reporters allowed him access to private documents and conversations that fueled his belief that top members of Nixon’s team were involved in the break-ins. The media referred to his independent investigation in news reports as the “third front.&quot; Lowell Weicker and staffers who worked with him at the time, however, believed the personal investigation was more of a supplement to, rather than a separate investigation from the Watergate committee. As another part of his independent investigation, Weicker explored President Nixon’s tax records from 1968–72, arguing that Nixon had illegally categorized his presidential papers as tax-deductible “gifts” to the National Archives.</p>
            <h5>White House Tapes</h5>
            <p> During the Watergate investigation, testimony from John Dean led the committee to suspect there were tape recordings of conversations between President Nixon and other staffers. In July 1973 the Watergate investigation committee issued subpoenas for the White House tapes John Dean discussed in his testimony. President Nixon claimed executive privilege and refused to turn over the tapes. The Supreme Court Case (<span class="court-case">U.S. vs. Nixon</span>), however, unanimously ruled the Nixon tapes must be turned over to investigators and narrowed the grounds the President can claim executive privilege. In early August of 1974, Nixon released the &quot;smoking gun&quot; transcripts that revealed President Nixon obstructed the Senate and independent counsel investigations into the Watergate break-ins and directed the cover-up operation thereafter. Three days after the release of the White House tapes, President Nixon resigned from the office of President.          </p>
