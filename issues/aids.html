          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>When the AIDS epidemic hit the U.S. in the 1980s, scientists, researchers, and advocates pleaded with the federal government to take action against the deadly virus. As chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services (LHHS) Committee, Senator Lowell Weicker, Jr., played a vital role in getting the federal government, the NIH, the CDC, and Congress to address the AIDS epidemic. Weicker took part in heated debates with Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) and others who opposed providing funding for the research, education, and prevention of AIDS. When Senator Helms, President Ronald Reagan, and religious right leaders condemned the “gay plague” and allocated minimal funds to the disease, Senator Weicker repeatedly denounced political and religious objections to funding AIDS research, for he was a firm believer that science must be free from politics and religious beliefs.</p>

          <h4>Philosophy</h4>
          <p>AIDS was not an issue of politics or religion for Lowell Weicker. He believed the government should not ask people how they got sick and treat them differently because of their actions, but should address the problem from a public health perspective. When faced with the public health epidemic, Senator Weicker’s priority was to stop the spread of the virus, treat those who were suffering, and ensure the government intervened and protected Americans. In order to stop the spread of the deadly AIDS virus, Weicker used his position in Congress to ensure that Americans received much needed educational and preventative information. Senator Weicker based his position in favor of education and prevention on the reports coming from the NIH and CDC. In a time of fiscal and social conservatism, Weicker was able to lead the controversial fight against the epidemic. During the mid-1980s, he ensured the NIH and CDC received boosts in funding in a time of budget cuts, allowed for more biomedical research, and protected the rights of all Americans. </p>
          <h4>The Fight for Funding</h4>
          <p>With the death of Representative Stewart McKinney (R-CT), a close friend of Weicker’s, Senator Weicker intensified his efforts for more funding, research, and support for those suffering from AIDS. During his time as chairman of the LHHS subcommittee, Weicker worked closely with legislative aide Maureen Byrnes on appropriating funds for AIDS research. Both Weicker and Byrnes were disappointed with the Reagan Administration’s response to the AIDS epidemic, and denounced the administration’s ignorance despite warnings from the CDC, NIH, and even Surgeon General Koop. </p>
          <p>Weicker continuously and enthusiastically pushed to support funding research of the disease and assist those suffering from AIDS/HIV. “Riboviron” (known as AZT) emerged as a successful treatment for AIDS and extended the lives of thousands with AIDS for six months or more. AZT was a major breakthrough in biomedical research from the NIH, and Senator Weicker, a longtime supporter of biomedical research and AIDS treatment, called for $40-50 million in funding for AZT treatment.</p>
<h4>The Watkins Commission</h4>
          <p>While Weicker and his staffers were skeptical of the Presidential Commission on AIDS, the chair, Admiral Watkins, became a close ally. From the Watkins Commission came advocacy and action on behalf of the federal government. AIDS became an issue about human rights, discrimination, and equal protection under the law, mirroring Senator Weicker’s own values and philosophies. During his time in the Senate, Weicker’s involvement in securing funding to combat the AIDS epidemic was just one instance where he fought hard to secure the rights of the marginalized. </p>
          <h4>Opposition</h4>
          <p>Weicker was not always successful in his AIDS legislation. His major opponent, Senator Jesse Helms, would repeatedly fight against Weicker and AIDS legislation. Helms was responsible for introducing legislation that would block funding for AIDS education programs, citing that education was condoning inappropriate behavior. Others like Terry Krieger asserted that AIDS was only a “crisis in statistics” and only those “weakened by drug use” were susceptible to the virus. Weicker constantly had to rebut these allegations and fight for additional funding. In addition, Weicker had to fight public attitudes about gays. Weicker complained that attitudes about the “gay plague” (as the media referred to it) were not conducive to federal attention. Weicker believed that “if it wasn’t perceived as primarily affecting the homosexual community, the government would have acted sooner and more appropriately.”</p>
          <p>Weicker’s key allies in the Senate and House included Senator Thomas Harkin (D-IA), Senator Ted Weiss (D-NY), Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA), and Representative Stewart McKinney (R-CT) (up until his death). Additionally, Weicker cosponsored with Senator Edward Kennedy S. 1220, the Health Omnibus Act, the “first significant federal policy… for increased research, education, and prevention activities,” including education for school-aged children.</p>

          <h5>AIDS Education, Counseling, and Services Act of 1986</h5>
          <p>The AIDS Education, Counseling, and Services Act of 1986 was a piece of legislation responsible for setting up a network of coordinated outpatient medical services for AIDS patients. As cities across the country ran out of financial resources to treat the AIDs epidemic, the NIH and Surgeon General Koop recommended the federal government allocate over $15 million for outpatient treatment. The government concluded outpatient treatment as a more cost-effective method to handle the AIDS epidemic.</p>

          <h5>Arline Decision</h5>
          <p>March 3, 1987 : 
          The Supreme Court hands down its ruling in School Board of Nassau County, Florida v. Arline. The decision stipulated that people with contagious disease must be regarded as handicapped and are protected by anti-discrimination laws. Thus, protection extended to those with the contagious disease, AIDS. Weicker and others filed an amicus brief, supporting the points upheld by the Court’s decision. The decision refuted the Justice Department’s argument that employers can fire AIDS victims if they feel there is a health risk.</p>

          <h5>S. 1220 Comprehensive AIDS Legislation</h5>
          <p>In 1988, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) introduced S. 1220 in the Senate and with the help of several Congressmen, Sen. Lowell Weicker (as a cosponsor) among them, S. 1220 became the first and most comprehensive piece of AIDS legislation. The bill amended the Public Health Service Act to provide a comprehensive program of education, information, risk reduction, training, prevention, treatment, care, and research concerning AIDS. Sen. Lowell Weicker's potential amendment aimed to add in-school “AIDS education for school-age children to the list of activities for which states [could] use their AIDS prevention funds” (Congressional Record). S. 1220 came on the heels of the Watkins Commission report, and it sought to address the concerns and implement the suggestions of the report. The bill also established an AIDS Coordinator, who became responsible for a National Program on AIDS. Sen. Jesse Helms, a regular opponent to AIDS legislation and funding, opposed the bill and attempted to add his own amendments into S. 1220. Helms' amendments failed to pass while Sen. Lowell Weicker's amendments became a vital part of this piece of legislation. S. 1220 allocated $600 million for the Fiscal Year 1988 for AIDS funding and research.</p>

          <h5>S. 1374 AIDS Act</h5>
          <p>This senate bill declared AIDS as a national public health emergency and called for an increase in training, services, and public information. The bill was primarily sponsored by Sen. Kennedy, but Sen. Weicker’s aide Kim Elliott contributed her thoughts to the bill before it came to the floor of the Senate.</p>
          <h5>S. 1352 AIDS Control Act</h5>
          <p>Senator Weicker's main opponent in debates over how to address the AIDS epidemic, Senator Jesse Helms, introduced the AIDS Control Act (S. 1352), which categorized the donation of blood, semen, or organs by an individual at high risk or with AIDS as a federal crime. The bill would also require a federal license for blood banks and annual AIDS testing for military personnel, as well as the repeal of D.C.’s insurance law and the closing of gay bathhouses.</p>
          <h5>S. 1575 The AIDS Federal Policy Act of 1987</h5>
          <p>This bill expanded the availability of voluntary AIDS testing and counseling, protected the confidentiality of testing and counseling records, and prohibited discrimination against those who tested positive for AIDS. Senator Weicker argued that this bill resulted from the medical community's public health recommendations. While Sen. Jesse Helms immediately attached his recurring amendment to the bill, Sen. Weicker’s office had prepared a rebuttal, which argued for D.C. “home rule.” Under current D.C. law companies were not required to insure AIDS patients and delayed AIDS testing for five years, until adequate actuarial data could be developed to assess the appropriate insurance rate. The D.C. law thus minimized the cost of health care for AIDS patients covered by the government.</p>
          <p class="sources">Sources: Congressional Record, 05/03/1983</p>
          <h5>S. 613 Congressional Advisory Panel on AIDS Act</h5>
          <p>This bill created a panel to evaluate and improve information sharing among agencies dealing with AIDS. Special grants, given out by Secretary of Health and Human Services, specifically targeted the AIDS crisis. In total, the bill appropriated over $3 million from 1987 to 1992. Senator Weicker, a cosponsor of the bill, spoke in support of it on March 3, 1987.</p>
          <p class="sources">Sources: CR 3.3.87</p>
          <h5>S. 79 High Risk Occupational Disease Notification Bill</h5>
          <p>This bill designated workers at risk of occupational exposure to AIDS as a “risk population.” In order to reduce the risk of infection in the workplace, Senator Edward Kennedy proposed a substitute to disseminate information to all health workers. Senator Weicker supported the Kennedy proposal, but Senator Helms sought to add an amendment to &quot;undermine the scientific principles&quot; of the bill by creating a Risk Assessment Board (Snider). Because the amendment was opposed by the American Medical Association, Senators Weicker and Kennedy wrote their colleagues to urge them to oppose the Helms Amendment to S. 79. This bill would also bring back debate over transmission of AIDS through casual contact (handshakes, coughing, etc).</p>
          <p class="sources">Sources: Snider Box 1</p>
          <h5>The Watkins Commission</h5>
          <p>The Presidential AIDS Commission, known as the Watkins' Commission, formed in September of 1987 as a part of the federal government's response to the AIDS epidemic. While Sen. Weicker's staff was skeptical the commission was an attempt to derail biomedical research on the AIDS epidemic, Senator Weicker and the NIH worked together with the Watkins Commission. Admiral Watkins actually took to Weicker's opinion on the AIDS epidemic and recommended for more biomedical research. In addition, Admiral Watkins urged the federal government to take a stance on discrimination against those with AIDS. While Weicker and his staffers had doubts about the results of this commission, the commission supported the same initiatives that Weicker and his colleagues fought to achieve (Weicker).</p>
