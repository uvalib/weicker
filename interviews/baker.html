          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is Phyllis Leffler. Today is April 13, 2010. I’m conducting an interview with Geoffrey Baker at 1725 20th Street Northwest as part of the Lowell Weicker Oral History Project. So welcome, and thank you for doing this. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Thank you. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I would like to start out by your just telling me your full name, and then if you could just speak a little bit about your own background before you joined the staff of Lowell Weicker. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Okay. My name is Geoffrey Burnett Baker. I was born in New York City; I grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. I went to Greenwich Country Day School and away to prep school at Deerfield and then out to college in Stanford. My connection with Lowell Weicker began as he was the first selectman of Greenwich, which was in effect mayor. So while I did not know him personally, he was somebody I had seen. I had followed his career locally. And then of course he went to the House of Representatives. I can speak to how I joined his staff, if that would be helpful. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Please. That would be great. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, as I said, I actually brought a few papers to refer to. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I wish we were videotaping. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000130"></a>0:01:30</p>
          <p class="c-header">Baker’s experience as a summer intern in Weicker’s office</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, actually, I must confess to all and for posterity that this is to help me refresh my memory as we go. I have a letter dated December 3, 1969, that was addressed to me at Stanford, where I was in college. I’ll read it, just a few lines, to give you a flavor. This is from Lowell P. Weicker Jr., member of Congress from the 4th District, which was my district in Connecticut. </p>
          <p>“Many thanks for your letter of November 23 in which you expressed an interest in a summer position as an intern in Congress for 1970.” And it says he has not made any definitive commitments, but “I’d like to hear more and get your resume. Come in for an appointment when you’re in Greenwich, at home.” </p>
          <p>I have some other correspondence related to this, but essentially I was in college and I had not been drafted. I had friends who were going to Vietnam, but I felt I should be doing something useful, so I thought I’d go to Washington. Well, that’s a great idea, and I didn’t know anything about it. There wasn’t a program at the time, although Stanford now has Stanford in Washington, and I’m sure many colleges do. I’m sure Virginia and others do. And so I just thought of the only politician I that knew, which was Lowell Weicker, my first selectman, now Congressman. I wrote to him and said I’d like to come to Washington for a summer. And this is just an indication that I actually did do that. He thought about it and eventually accepted me as a summer intern. As it turned out I came in the summer of 1970, and then I had another summer in 1971.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You would have been brand new in Congress.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes, and then he was running for Senate. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Very short order. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes. I came back and was hired after that. I’m very appreciative of summer internships because that’s how I started in Washington. I’ve lived in Washington and my two sons have grown up here. I encouraged them to become summer interns, and they were interns both on the Hill and at the White House over the years. So I credit Lowell Weicker for bringing me to Washington. I also thought it was a very valuable experience. It was everything I hoped it was. And it led to my first position, which was as a legislative aide, along with Bob Dotchin in my class. And of course from that point, Watergate, and a very exciting early experience on the Hill, which I thought would be very brief because I was planning on going to law school. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So if I can just clarify this. You came in for two different summers when you were still at Stanford. So this would have been your junior and senior years at Stanford?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes. It was senior year, let’s see now, ’70. No, it was junior and senior. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And after you completed the second internship you stayed on as a legislative aide?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, as it turned out, I did a year of graduate work at Stanford and then I came back and went to work. That was the plan. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And your graduate work was in what?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Actually it was at the school of education. But I decided—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Not to pursue that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>—not to pursue it. I always wonder about that. I came back to Washington and eventually went to law school. So that was the plan. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>For the record, although this cannot be seen, this shows that I really did save some things. This is my student intern card— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That is fantastic. That’s wonderful. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>—from that period. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It must’ve been very meaningful if you saved it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes, and again this cannot be seen, but I used to be very young, and that’s a picture of me with Lowell Weicker in the <span class="work-title">Greenwich Time</span> newspaper. So. And here is a— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s very nice. And he’s looking a lot younger too. [laughter] As we all do. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, I assume this is all in the archive. And then, just to give you a flavor, this is a picture of a summer internship group. This is Bob Dotchin. And there’s me as a young man. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>These are all summer interns. So he would’ve taken 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes, and there may have been others, but that was one photograph. Actually, in going through my papers a couple of summer ago, I came across a number of photographs that I gave to Lowell and Claudia [Weicker] for the archives. Not that they’re critical, but they showed some pictures of our group when we were all that age. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000628"></a>0:06:28</p>
          <p class="c-header">Baker joins Weicker’s staff as legislative aide</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you come on as a legislative aide. This would have been 1972?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes. It would’ve been the summer of ’72. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So right at the start of Watergate? Or— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes. I have to be careful, because I don’t know the exact timeline, but Senator Weicker was appointed to the Watergate Committee eventually. But that time period was a period of the election and many of the events. And then the follow-up in ’73, ’74, had to do with the Watergate Committee and the eventual resignation of the President. Bob Dotchin I mention because he and I came out of college at the same time and we were colleagues and followed a career on the Hill very closely, always affiliated with Lowell Weicker in one way or another. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, tell me about that. How long did you stay with the Senator? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I left at the end of 1982, so it was essentially—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Ten years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>—ten years of employment on the Hill. And during the middle of that, from ’75 to ’77, I was on the staff of the Senate Commerce Committee. That, I know, is one of the questions that you have, and I can clarify how that all came about. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. But then you said you went on and stayed on the Hill. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Oh, no. Actually, Bob Dotchin stayed on longer than I did. But for me, and I think at the time all the young aides, thought of ourselves as going to the Hill for a couple of years, going to law school, going on to something else. I just recall that with the excitement of the Watergate Committee, Weicker’s close involvement in that, it sort of put all thought of following a career path out of mind. You couldn’t imagine anything more interesting than being on the Hill, involved in an office that was closely involved in the Watergate Committee, at least I couldn’t. So I put off going to law school for several years. I’m glad I did. I had a great experience. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you went back to law school after— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I actually went to Georgetown Law, where I met my wife. But I was working at the same time, so I went to night school. I got my law degree while I was working at the Commerce Committee, and then back at Lowell Weicker’s office. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I certainly think that what you’ve just said about the excitement of working in Congress in those years, and particularly on some of these issues that Congressman and then Senator Weicker was involved in, has been corroborated by some of the other interviews that I’ve already had. I haven’t had many, but I already have this sense that that’s a consistent, people feeling very invested and very excited about the issues that they’re working on. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So clearly, since we don’t quite have all of this right, perhaps you can just tell me what were the issues you started working on initially, and maybe you can just explain what you did with those issues. Do you want to follow this chronologically? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, I want to be careful. I want to follow the issues, and I can follow your issues in any way that you want. Essentially what happened was that from 1972 to June of 1974 I was a legislative aide, which meant I worked on any number of issues, whatever I was assigned internally within the office. Those did include space, oceans, and the environment, but I think the one set of issues that may not have been highlighted in the materials that you have was that consistently in my career there we were concerned with surface transportation issues, railroad issues, particularly starting with the failure of the New Haven Railroad and moving into the creation of Amtrak, the efforts to sustain low-density freight lines in New England, and eventually the creation of Conrail, which took over all the freight lines in the northeast. That was consistently an issue that Congressman and Senator Weicker obviously had great concern about, and I worked closely with him on those issues and the staff. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001127"></a>0:11:27</p>
          <p class="c-header">Senate Commerce Committee and focus on railroad issues</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I went to the Senate Commerce Committee. You have some information that Mary MacAuliffe, who was Senator Weicker’s staffer, was assigned to the Commerce Committee, and I was to move over to Commerce in 1975. I have correspondence here that explains all this, but Senator [James B.] Pearson, who was the minority, that is, the ranking minority member, which meant he was the lead Republican Senator, had negotiated a deal where I could come over if he could have my services. Mary stayed as a Weicker staffer involved in many of the Commerce issues. But I was essentially assigned to work for Senator Pearson on the minority side. Now, that did not mean I wasn’t working closely with Senator Weicker.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s fascinating. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>It’s just that Senator Pearson claimed my services so that he could essentially call me a professional staff member of the Committee. I worked closely with Senator Weicker, but all the Senators on rail issues in particular. I also did certain utility energy issues that were under the purview of the Commerce Committee and also ocean issues and so forth. But Mary and I, while we were both associated with the Commerce Committee, were under different classifications. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who paid your salary? Do you know? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Who paid my salary? The Committee paid my salary. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you were no longer technically— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>During that period I was no longer technically in the employ of Senator Weicker. However, I will say for the record that as far as Senator Weicker is concerned, I’m sure that during that period he put me to work on the Senate Commerce Committee. I was working on issues that were important to him and to Connecticut and the region. But my focus was whatever Senator Pearson asked me to do. It just turned out that there was a confluence of interests in terms of rail issues. So I spent most of my time on railroad issues. </p>
          <p>The timeline is that in June 1974—I have a note here that June 1974 to March 1975 I was Senator Weicker’s legislative assistant, which meant I basically managed the legislative operations and staff. Then I went for two years plus to the Senate Commerce Committee. And from 1977 through 1982 I came back to Senator Weicker’s office as a legislative assistant. Part of the reason that all this happened is that Bob Dotchin and I came on at the same time and we were legislative aides and moving up, taking on responsibility at the same time. He moved in the direction of the Small Business Committee and so forth, so his focus was more on small business. He was very much Senator Weicker’s man in that whole arena. We still continued to work as a team, and during that time that I was on the Commerce Committee, although I technically wasn’t on Senator Weicker’s staff, I still considered myself a member of the Weicker team.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Loyal to the team. Right. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001540"></a>0:15:40</p>
          <p class="c-header">Animal welfare amendments and interstate commerce</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes. All of the issues that that I worked on, you’ve identified a number of them. I remember it’s kind of interesting that I worked on the—and here’s a copy just of one bill and report, the Animal Welfare Amendments of 1975, and I’m sure you have that. But I happened to save that because I think it was the first bill that I actually had the largest hand in writing and reporting and so forth. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>And it was interesting that this wasn’t the biggest issue obviously in the world, but it was an issue that he cared about and we did something about it. Fast forward to the current day. My wife and I have Rhodesian Ridgebacks—we only have one now, we’re down to one—but if there’s one issue in the world that she cares about, it’s humane treatment of animals. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you came by this very early. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>And this was before I met her. Everyone has issues that they sort of started off with, and this is one of the issues that was memorable for me. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Before we go on, why do you think the Senator cared so much about this? What did that come out of? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I believe if I reread the report I could give you a better sense of how we approached the issue. Normally, in the legislative arena, many of the issues came up because either a constituent, or a group of constituents, or a constituent corporation had been in touch with our office and alerted us to an issue. I believe that in this case—although you have to ask Senator Weicker about his love of dogs, but he’s always had dogs. I believe if I think back upon it, it was, at the time, articles about the mistreatment of animals, particularly in air transportation from Connecticut, that caused us to take a look at this. I remember going over to Reagan Airport, it was then National Airport, to look at the cargo facilities and talk to the staff over there about how they handled animals so we could get a good sense of what we needed to do to regulate the air. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>My notes here, I don’t know if this is correct or not, say that your ability to regulate animal treatment at the federal level stemmed from a broad interpretation of federal authority over interstate commerce?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, I think when you think about particularly air transportation that that was pretty obvious. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Reading that now that’s going to be—you know we’re going to have an interesting case on these issues.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Health care, particularly. Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Before the Supreme Court within two years. I wasn’t thinking about that. No. Whenever he got hold of an issue he was prepared to tackle it. I realize that this issue was raised up in some of the questions you ask, but it wasn’t so much creating big government, it was finding a way to deal with issues in a rational and responsible way, I think. This was something that there wasn’t a great deal of opposition to. The problem with any regulation, even in these years, was that there’s some cost to regulation. It would require airlines or other transportation modes to spend more time and money to take care of the animals in this case. No one really likes to do that unless they can be convinced it’s a reasonable solution. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>So whether it was protection of coral reefs, or of scientific research in the space program, I don’t think any of the issues that he tackled were radical issues. And the solutions that he proposed were not radical solutions, but many of them, if you go down the list, have not been given a lot of attention. If I recall, and I’m not an expert, coming through the late 1960s in college, issues like environmental protection and preservation were only just getting attention. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s absolutely right. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s involvement in oceans and space research</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>And so legislative and regulatory solutions to these problems were just being considered, and they obviously weren’t all dealt with during that period. But I think when you think of the oceans, and I was not the expert on the oceans, Bob Wicklund and others were really experts. I recall my responsibilities, more to make sure we got something done. We had our legislative team working on these issues properly and getting something done. So managing the process more than anything else, but with the oceans there wasn’t anyone else who was really championing the oceans. But once Senator Weicker got underwater and started scuba diving and meeting the people who were doing the research and trying to preserve the reefs and large parts of the ocean, he began to appreciate the issue as one that should receive national attention.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Absolutely. I have interviewed Bob Wicklund and also have read through an enormous amount of documentation on this, and it really seems like it’s something he became very passionate about. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes. Well, I think it’s just an example, if you’re asking me how do these things happen. Bob Wicklund was the expert and Tim Keeney and others that he met and worked with on the staff and off the staff. He usually had some direct interest in what was going on and he did understand. He wasn’t looking for the issue, the issue came to him and he developed it. I think that’s to his credit. I don’t get any credit for the oceans because all I did was help. Others inspired him, others informed him and educated him. But that’s one area. The space program was another that he was very involved in, the Space Committee. </p>
          <p>I happened to run across these documents. I went down to Cape Canaveral on a number of occasions with the Senator and to see space shots. This was some of the material that we got from one of the space flights when we were down there. I happened to just keep that folder and somehow put it in a box. But that was an exciting time too. I mean the promise of space travel and exploration seemed limitless at that time, particularly after [John F.] Kennedy set us in motion. </p>
          <p>It tied in in many ways as you look across Lowell Weicker’s career at scientific research, medical research, environmental research. There are many issues where he felt that we could do more and it was worth the investment. So I think a lot of the issues that you’ve identified, and others—he did feel that an investment in research would yield tremendous dividends for the country, and not just for individuals, but for the broader country and internationally. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Now you’re raising the space program. This is not something I have seen him write about in his book, <span class="work-title">Maverick</span>. Maybe I’ve missed it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I don’t recall. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are you aware that he was particularly invested in that issue? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, he was on the Committee. Other than that I don’t think I have anything with me that relates to it specifically. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think you’re quite right that it’s an example of putting resources into research for causes that hadn’t gotten much attention, and I would’ve expected him to support it, but— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, I just recall it as something that was very exciting at the time. It may not have been his top priority, but he was a strong supporter and he understood it and he made the effort. It may have been that we did more work at the staff level on this issue and he didn’t consider it as important. But he was involved and he was on the Space Committee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I think I should correct myself on this. I think he actually writes in his chapter about exploration of a variety of worlds. He invested himself, I think, most in the world of the oceans, but he understood that the world of space was equally important. So— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I want to be careful that I’m giving you just my clear recollections, but I’m also trying to connect some of the dots here because you’ve asked me to think about what this has meant to me and how to understand Lowell Weicker’s career that I knew on the Hill. And as I know his life and interests, he pushed hard in areas that not only needed attention but needed investment. In a later time he got more involved with issues of the disabled and medical research, which has become if not his top, one of his top issues even now. I can look back in my experience, and that was early in the career that the notion of exploring the oceans was something that when he was first introduced to it, he didn’t know very much about it, I don’t believe, as none of us did. But he really dug into it and he realized there was a lot there, and it wasn’t just life forms, it was energy and minerals and all sorts of things. We needed to explore the oceans and he— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>With aquaculture and— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Oh yes, and as you know, he spent time living down below. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think Bob Wicklund told me he was one of only two members of Congress who ever did that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, I think that reflects his willingness when he got engaged in something to commit himself. He’s willing to do anything. And as you look at his legislative career, as I recall it, and my involvement particularly on issues that involved floor debates, filibusters, and those sorts of things, there were criticisms of Lowell Weicker over the years that he would grandstand issues. But there’s an example where yes, he in effect promoted himself. There were pictures of him underwater and so forth. But he did it for a very real purpose, and that is to bring attention to the issue, which to his credit, he was successful in doing. I can’t think of anyone else at that time or since who’s invested as much. Now, the space program was not as important to him, but you could tie this together and say that his support for a program like that just as his support for medical research is trying to extend frontiers of knowledge. And beyond what he could even understand or we could understand, but we knew there was a lot out there. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002802"></a>0:28:02</p>
          <p class="c-header">Commuter and freight transportation issues</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>And I think that’s what for a number of us who worked with him, and however difficult life was, it was inspiring to be involved in a lot of these issues. Not all of them. I’m sure for most people the idea of railroad legislation is as boring as it gets, but for the northeast, for Connecticut commuter rail, freight rail, still very relevant in those times. We know we haven’t been as successful with rail in American as we should’ve been, but now we’re rethinking it. Now we’re getting some high-speed corridors. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Now we’re even getting trolley lines in Washington. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And some of this is also going on during the oil crisis. Right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Oh, yes. Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The oil reserve and the need to think about alternative means of transportation, and I think the issues with rail—you should tell me if you see it differently, but the issues with rail transportation are tied in with larger issues, also environmental protection at the same time. So they’re all kind of coming together at the same time, aren’t they? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Right. Yes. Well, this is off the subject, but you raise a good question, because you can argue strongly that freight rail transportation environmentally makes a great deal of sense because of getting trucks off the road and all that. And I think that railroads make a good case for themselves. I’m just thinking that in fact the reason that we are burning as much coal as we are is because the railroads are bringing in coal from Wyoming, which is where it’s been found, and it’s easy to get out and move around. So there are all sorts of issues. In New England and in the northeast we were just trying to keep business alive and transportation along that northeast corridor. You know, offer some alternative to I-95. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know I don’t remember the exact dates of this, but I do remember reading that Weicker proposed that certain monies from federal highway bills be allowed to be used for other forms of public transportation, specifically rail. Do you remember that? Were you involved with any of that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I’m sure I was involved. I don’t know specifically what it is, I can’t point to a specific time or speech, but the context of our working on these issues—at that time there were a number of moderate Republicans he worked closely with as well as Democrats, and he worked well across the aisle, in fact. But in the New York Metropolitan region, if you think about Senator [Jacob] Javits and others who were very prominent at that time, commuter rail tied in very well to mass transit. Commuter rail for Connecticut was as important as money for subways in New York City for Senator Javits. </p>
          <p>And so there was a confluence of interests in terms of many of the urban or ex-urban Senators at that time. Not that they were building a great number of highways, but there wasn’t a lot of money available to save the railroads and to save the subway systems—urban transit, but that’s been a struggle forever. We had a struggle over many years once Amtrak was created to make sure that Amtrak was funded. Unfortunately, Amtrak never made any money, and so therefore it needed constant funding, and it’s still been an issue. It’s not quite as bad as the post office, but<br>
            it’s a struggle. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>As an aside, we’ve just created a new short haul. I don’t know if that’s the right term, but this short rail trip between Lynchburg, Virginia, and Washington D.C., going through Charlottesville, adding one more train a day to the route. There used to be just one train a day, there are now two. A member of the city council of Charlottesville and a former member were very influential in getting this to happen, and it has apparently been incredibly successful. It started out being something that was going to be heavily subsidized. It’s actually made money. So I think there’s a lot of interest now in having alternate forms of transportation between that southern corridor and the Washington, D.C., area. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, unfortunately the northeast corridor is an old and inefficient corridor. It needs to be reworked, and it’s going to be very expensive. But they can build some other corridors elsewhere. I am certain that if Senator Weicker were involved in any way legislatively now, this would be a top issue. Transportation would still be a top issue for him. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So in your work on transportation issues, this is when you are a legislative aide. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Initially. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Initially, and then do you remember anything about the process itself of working on these kinds of issues that you think is valuable to talk about?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, in terms of the actual work, I think Senator Weicker was very good about giving staff a directive, “We need to do something about this,” but then letting staff go to work. And so we were given a lot of responsibility and expected to show initiative and get the job done. I’m not saying that I did, but we all did. We all worked together. So the process was one where the staff was given a lot of responsibility, and I respect that. That’s true on all issues. And that’s not always true, but that’s what I recall about those times. </p>
          <p>When I came to his office I had grown up in Greenwich, but only as a boy. I had traveled up to Massachusetts for summers and so I knew how to go up 95. But I didn’t know Connecticut that well. One of the first things that I did so I would understand where people were when they called in—because many constituents called in on all these issues—is I ordered up a big wall map of Connecticut and I had it up right next to my telephone—it’s about three feet by five feet. People thought it was kind of silly, but I didn’t know Connecticut. </p>
          <p>So you ask how these things get done. Somebody calls in a small business up in the northeast corner of Connecticut that I didn’t really know and says, “We’re losing a short-haul line or low-density line, and what can you do about it?” Well, obviously, to develop a legislative response you first have to look into the situation and how the various state agencies and federal agencies are handling the matter and why they’re doing it. And in many cases we were responding with broader legislation to initial calls from constituents who were losing their freight access, for example. </p>
          <p>Business in Connecticut was declining in many of the traditional industries in the Waterbury area and throughout the state. Losing jobs to the South where non-union jobs were and so forth. So this was a constant struggle of trying to help business stay in New England, stay in Connecticut. </p>
          <p>I’m not sure I’m answering the question, but the process was essentially responding to constituents and constituent interests, and doing it in a way that would build coalitions with other states, other Senators. So if we had a problem in Connecticut, we’d call on the Senators throughout New England, and the New York Senators get together at a staff level and say, “Okay, we obviously need to protect our region. What can we do?” And we’d talk to federal agencies and members of Congress also, and try to put together a consensus plan, a piece of legislation that we knew we could get through our committees in the Senate. Pass the Senate as well as go through the House. Very often those were solutions that ended up in bigger bills. They were just a piece, but we put them in. But that’s the nature of, as you know, the legislative process. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. Were there any issues that you worked on that you remember as being particularly thorny or difficult in terms of building the kinds of coalitions you needed to build in order to make progress? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, Senator Weicker was considered a fiscal conservative going into his career—a fiscal conservative and a social moderate. But as his record shows, he was engaged in many social issues. The toughest issues were issues where I actually did spend a lot of time with him on the floor of the Senate in either filibusters or extended debate on issues like school busing and abortion, and so forth. Those were difficult issues because at that time it was not as partisan, as unpleasant an environment, particularly in the Senate, as it is now. Senators and their staffs worked well across the aisle. Senator Weicker had a number of— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s almost hard to believe that— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>It’s true. Senator Weicker had good friends who were very conservative, both in his party and on the other side. Of course the Democrats then were not a liberal party so much as a southern party. And they still have many of the committee chairmen who were southern Democrats and they were very conservative across the board. I mean, they worked together as Democrats— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>It was a very different party, and the Republican Party was more New England oriented or was more a moderate sort of party. Now they’ve all changed quite a bit. But moderate Republicans got along well with each other. Moderate Republicans also got along well with the northeastern and urban Democrats. They just agreed on a lot of issues. But socially they would see each other. They might have a very acrimonious debate one afternoon or evening, but on many occasions Senator Weicker would go out with his more conservative friends and opponents on many issues and have a drink afterwards.</p>
          <p>I think that you can’t always say that the debates that you heard or you read about on the floor were entirely civil, but there was a certain level of civility in social relationships both at the staff level and the principal level in the Senate at that time. I constantly say that to my friends today, particularly those that are younger friends who may be working up on the Hill, because that was a very different time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It just seems like the kinds of things that got done in the ’70s and ’80s—I can’t imagine we could do them now. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>In any case— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>If you look back and anyone was asking about Lowell Weicker’s career, the toughest times were when he would very often on his own take a stand, particularly on a social issue, and— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>—not give up. He wasn’t always successful, but he believed in the issues, and he felt that his responsibility was to not only speak out, but to try to either slow down the process or at least make sure that the national debate was two-sided. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Now you just referred to, a moment ago, floor debates on school busing and abortion, and I think you said you were there with him for those debates. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, it’s different now, but in those old days, staff could sit with the Senator or could spend time down on the floor. It was not as well regulated as it is now. They do regulate staff. But if Senator Weicker was making a speech, he would generally have a staff person sitting in a chair next to him. You see that still now, but if you were waiting for that time, you could come down if you were advising him and sit on the floor. There were sofas in the back. The only problem with sitting on the sofas was they were very comfortable and you could easy nod off. [laughter] </p>
          <p>But that’s true of any of the people that you will speak to. If the Senator was giving a speech on oceans, Bob Wicklund would be down there. Or small business, Bob Dotchin would be down there with him. And if he was involved in a filibuster, the purpose of having staff there is to make sure that he has the material to read or to refer to so that he can speak for a long period of time. I don’t have that kind of material here today, but if you look at the floor debates that he was involved in, very often he was speaking at length, and that was a very important part of his reputation in the Senate, because he was willing to take that time and he was willing to take the criticism for slowing up the Senate. Or for criticizing particularly conservative Senators who opposed his view. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But that time you think he was also using to get the view across, and to try to—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Oh yes. School busing is not an issue now, but it was then. And he believed strongly in its value. You can make arguments on all sides about whether it’s been successful. I’m not arguing for it, I’m just saying it was a timely issue, and it was resisted by a number of the southern and conservative Senators. And rather than just saying no or voting no, he was willing to put himself out front and take the heat. He didn’t gain any friends over it, but I think most people respected him for his principles because he didn’t do that on every issue. But the issues that he did believe in, he tried to figure out a way to be influential. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Baker becomes chief legislative assistant to Senator Weicker</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Now, you said between ’77 and ’82 you were, I guess, the chief legislative assistant, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that means you’re running the office, aren’t you?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>The office is run by the administrative assistant, who handles all of the administrative duties, the hiring and firing and all of that. And so technically the administrative assistant runs the office. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>The legislative assistant runs the legislative operation, which includes a staff of a number of people, including aides, interns, and so on. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>And is a liaison with the Committee staff, for example Bob Dotchin. I worked closely with Bob Dotchin because he was involved in small business issues. So as legislative assistant, if there was a small business issue, I would talk to Bob Dotchin. I wouldn’t try to handle it within our own operation. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And how—you must know—did you come to have that position? Because that seems like a very important position. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Oh, I was honored to be able to extend my career. As I said, Bob Dotchin and I came in at the same time with equal opportunity. He moved to the Committee, and earlier. We basically could’ve done different things, but we were the two legislative aides who stayed with him from his early career for the longest time, and for whatever reason Senator Weicker gave us both responsibility. Others came along, and of course I was succeeded by Kim Elliott and others. I was just an early legislative assistant. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And then this is still pretty early in your career though, so you’re pretty young when you’re doing this. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, as I say, it was a tremendous opportunity. For me, I think that there was a feeling among most of my staff colleagues that you come to the Hill while you’re young, and you’re willing to work around the clock, because many of these filibusters went into the night. I was not married until 1977, so I was pretty much on my own, and I loved it. Now, I wasn’t planning to do it, but I loved it. Eventually I went to law school, but most people came to the Hill for a few years and then went on with life. I ended up coming to the Hill for a few years, staying a lot longer, also doing law school, but really I didn’t go into a legal career as I expected to.</p>
          <p>When I was on the Commerce Committee, I think most if not all of my colleagues were lawyers. So there was a sense that at a certain point you should go to law school. But everyone there was relatively young. The nice thing about my life today is that many of my colleagues who stayed on who I knew then on both sides of the aisle, who stayed on in Washington, are my friends now. Close friends. Democrats and Republicans. But they stayed in Washington and they’ve gone to government or law or lobbying, and they’re still around. And Bob Dotchin is an example of somebody who’s still around. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So these were clearly—I mean, I think it’s incontrovertible that they were formative years for you and for everybody else. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Oh, no question. This is not a reflection on me, but I think that to have a chance to work on the Senate side was wonderful. To have a chance to work for Lowell Weicker was exciting for a lot of people. The people that you’ve talked to, I think that at least the ones you mentioned, they all had exciting careers in their time working with Weicker on the Hill. In some ways you can say well, it was an exciting time, and of course, but it was the responsibility you were given as a young staffer that really made the difference. I mean, none of us could have had that responsibility and experience that we had, even if we had been lawyers at that age. Because essentially we were writing legislation in many cases. </p>
          <p>I’ll give you an example of when I was early on involved in a conference committee. After bills pass the House and Senate, they go to conference committee to try to iron out the differences. Forget about health care. That had nothing to do with normal process. But one of my early memories of that period was—this was rail legislation that we were working on, and it was midnight. We were over on the House side, and the staff had so much responsibility it was amazing. The staff was trying to work out a certain section of rail legislation. </p>
          <p>Across the table from me was Tom Daschle, who was an aide to his congressman at the time. I remember this, not that we’re friends or colleagues or anything, but just that at a certain point that’s how you get started in life. You have these experiences, and so we’re sitting there and we could do anything. Essentially you could do anything responsible with the kind of legislation we were dealing with. Hundreds of pages, and I think we did good things. </p>
          <p>I’m very proud of the work that we did. But in my experience working with Senator Weicker and my experience working with Pearson on the Commerce Committee, sort of indirectly for Weicker, it’s incredible the amount of responsibility we were given and the opportunity we had to influence legislation. Given a direction by our principals, we were able to go to work, and I think I can’t imagine a more satisfying experience that I could have had anywhere else in Washington. Now, having said that, you can talk to any number of people who get opportunities early on in life, whether in government or elsewhere, and it’s exciting. My son had an exciting experience as a young person out of college working in the White House, and it is fortuitous.  But I look back on those years and I believe all of my colleagues of that time would say the same thing, that they couldn’t have imagined a better experience. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And as long as you’re saying that, what was it specifically about Lowell Weicker that made that experience as good as it was? It’s obviously not just the work you did; it had something to do with the man for sure, I would think. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Not that I know all the differences between the Senators at that time; I knew a number of them because I worked with them on various pieces of legislation. We would work with them and their staff closely through committees. When you contacted me about this interview, I did think about why it is after all these years I think fondly upon this experience, other than the opportunity, which you always appreciate. </p>
          <p>I think that having seen him most recently, I guess at a time when I came down to Charlottesville, of the group that was there it was a very warm feeling that if you were loyal to Lowell Weicker, Lowell Weicker was loyal to you and gave you opportunity and so forth. I’m not sure how I can express it any better than that. He engendered loyalty by giving opportunity and responsibility. Many people do that, but he rewarded it with more opportunity, and I was just very impressed by that. He took positions that I didn’t always agree with, and I’m not sure anyone who worked for him would always agree with the positions he took. But once he took a position, he stuck by it and he was forceful, and you had to respect him even when you disagreed with him. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Is there a particular example you can remember of an opinion that you ended up working to support that you personally didn’t? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, this is public, so I have to be careful about the issues; I did not and do not have the same view that he has on abortion issues. But I worked with him, and that was just my personal view. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>My view was that I would not want to promote the issue; however, I think that Senator Weicker, if I looked at it from his perspective, believed in the issue but had to promote it to give attention to it to counter the opposition that he had in the Senate to many of the programs and many of the assaults on rights, generally. So while that would not be an issue I would choose as a Senator, or necessarily agree with the way he handled it, my job was to work with him, and that was not one issue I would walk away from. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What was it like day-in and day-out, aside from working very hard? What was it like interacting with him? Did you end up seeing him every day to consult, or several times a day? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, that’s a good question, and I wish I had clearer memories. I think that the offices, perhaps they’re larger suites now, but they were fairly small suites. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So his coming and going.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>They were usually linear, so he would be in a far office on one far end of a linear set of offices, and so if he wanted to see somebody, he would have to walk through the front reception area. Through the press area through the legislative area, he would be passing back and forth, and even if he was not, he would call people in periodically if there was something, a meeting that he had to go to or whatever. </p>
          <p>I can’t recall or couldn’t imagine that there was a day where if you were working in his office you wouldn’t see him. You might not interact with him all the time. Now, as a legislative aide and assistant, I perhaps interacted with him as much as anyone, although the press officer and the administrative assistant would always see him, would always be working on scheduling and that sort of thing. What was it like in the office? I remember early offices that were very crowded and probably unsafe. I don’t know. No, they were just very crowded. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Fire laws or something. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>No. I remember that. They squeezed a lot of young people in together, and of course it didn’t matter, you were just happy to be there. But I remember the lighting was really poor. This is one of the things I’ve been involved in, actually—school projects since then and institutional projects and renovations. One of the first things that I think about is good lighting, particularly in an education setting. I had problems with eyesight and I found all the lighting to be very dim. I got a lot of headaches in my early years there. You spend long hours, you don’t eat necessarily as regularly as you should, the lighting’s bad. It was particularly bad on the Senate floor, and so I remember it as not a comfortable setting in general. I remember that as soon as I became legislative assistant, there was always someone—either my legislative secretary who sat with me or one of the aides—whenever they went down to the cafeteria, they’d always bring me up a cup of coffee. So while I didn’t smoke, I do remember always having a cup of coffee in my hand. I would wander around and see how everyone was doing. </p>
          <p>The environment that we worked in was not all that special except that the old buildings that we worked in were pretty grand. I remember drinking a lot of coffee. As I said, I didn’t smoke, but I had a lot of Snickers bars. That’s how I survived. I lived, fortunately, for a good bit of the time right across the street on Constitution Avenue at Second Street, just behind the Supreme Court. I do recall it was very easy to get out of bed if I was late and get into work, and likewise to go home. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs] Right. You also worked on financial and appropriations issues. Is that correct or not correct? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, it would be the whole range of issues. I think the normal process for government programs is authorizing legislation, and then going through the appropriations process where you actually spend the money. The authorization just says we authorized up to $100 million for rail transportation in Connecticut. Now, the appropriations process is different, and you might end up with $15 million one year, but it’s under an authorizing piece of legislation. </p>
          <p>What’s happened today, as I read it, is that the whole notion of authorizing legislation may have been downgraded because they tend to vote whatever they want to vote. Clearly the appropriations process is the most important, and when the Senator became a member of the Appropriations Committee and chaired subcommittees, he was very powerful in the sense that, assuming a program was authorized at the time, he was the one who could really determine how much he’d recommend spending on it. If you were not a member of the Appropriations Committee you would have to find an ally who believed in your program, because they would have their own programs that they wanted to fund. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>So the process was we worked closely with the Appropriations Committee whatever the issue was. Now, for example, it may not have been an issue like railroads or oceans or space or anything else, but a constituent might be interested in cancer research or something, and we would say, “We’ll do everything we can. We’ll try to add money to the program.” We’d have to work through the Appropriations Subcommittee, and it’s much harder, obviously, if you’re not on the Committee. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What were the issues that you worked on that you would say were the thorniest to resolve or make progress on? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, to make progress on? I think we made progress on all the issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Were there some that as you look back you see as having been more difficult? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, I think from a northeast perspective, selling a passenger rail system like Amtrak was not easy because you had to make sure that every state benefited from it. Likewise, Conrail, which was essentially a government takeover of freight transportation in the northeast, had to be sold. But I can’t think of one that was impossible, that we didn’t make some progress on. Whether it was lasting progress, I’m not sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m remembering seeing some documentation, which I wondered about. It’s from testimony from Senator Lowell Weicker for the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Technology on aquaculture legislation. This would be 1978, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In this testimony he basically argues that NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] should have a lot of responsibility for the aquaculture focus, and he goes on to argue that the other branch of government that should be involved is Commerce rather than Agriculture and Interior. He has a reason for it; he says it’s important to consolidate federal programs whenever possible, and so he argues for Commerce rather than Agriculture and Interior. I wondered if something like that, for example, would be controversial and would require a lot of negotiation? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well yes, but not earthshaking. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. It’s not Watergate. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>But aquaculture was a relatively new concept. It was getting more attention, and he was trying to give it attention. He had worked through the Commerce Committee and through NOAA directly on a number of issues related to the oceans. There were conflicts, of course. The conflict is that aquaculture sounds like agriculture, except that the Department of Agriculture at that time had no interest in promoting aquaculture—it wanted to do other things—other than perhaps catfish farming in Mississippi or something. So they didn’t have an interest in it. Likewise, Interior really didn’t have an interest in it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it was just a practical decision, you’re saying. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes, but the problem is no one likes to give up any authority. So yes, there’s a conflict there, and it’s not easy even if it makes sense. At this particular presentation Bob Wicklund might have been sitting at his side, or I might have been sitting at his side, and we’re just trying to make a case that this makes sense. He’s not fighting a battle, except the bureaucrats in Agriculture and Interior no doubt told their bosses that they could handle it and didn’t want the change. So it’s no different than almost any new legislation giving more power to a particular agency or taking power away from one. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>As you look back on your ten years, what do you consider to have been your biggest challenge? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, having arrived when I was just essentially out of college, I think everything that I did from day one was new and challenging. So for me, probably if I had to speak personally about my experience, it was just having the confidence to be able to work with a Senator like Senator Weicker, who was not only big, but bigger than life in many ways and mercurial at some points. But getting the job done and having the confidence that I could persuade others to help me do it, internally on the legislative staff—also one of the challenging things about working in the Senate or the House is trying to convince other Senators or congressmen that your issue is important to them and they should be interested in it so you can build a coalition and a consensus. I’m talking about smaller issues. Obviously an issue like health care has its own weight and momentum, so that’s not the case. But I think for me, in terms of my maturation in that period, it was developing confidence to work with people. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are there specific frustrations of having—I’m not really talking about Lowell Weicker per say, but I’m just talking about frustrations of the nature of the work that you were doing, that stick with you. You’ve talked about the joys of it, the excitement of it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, we were rarely entirely successful in our efforts. Creating a new program is very rewarding, but you have to sustain it and you have to fund it and so forth. Generally the frustrations were day-to-day frustrations. You can’t be frustrated about the fact that you’re not successful on every legislative battle. In fact, many of the battles we undertook, the Senator would agree, he didn’t expect to win. For example, on the social issues I don’t think he honestly felt that he would prevail, but he needed to make the point, and he did it, I think, in many cases eloquently and with credibility. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s just the nature of that work. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I think that the nature of the environment we worked in was that you try to build relationships, and I think that the plus side of it is that in most cases I felt it became easy to develop good relationships at the staff level, and I also knew a number of Senators. But the other side of that is that we weren’t always able to translate those relationships into meaningful progress on legislation. I mean you could just go so far. And you can tell from the number of issues that you researched and we discussed. </p>
          <p>Essentially, as I see it, a Senator is asked to represent his state, her state on all issues, and they can’t be influential or successful on all issues. But you have to make that effort. That’s constituent service. So in the end you’re being pulled in so many different directions. It’s important that you do have priority issues, and I think that Senator Weicker clearly picked his issues and stuck with them. Whether you agree or not, he made his mark on a number of issues and should be acknowledged for that. The frustration of life on the Hill is just not being able to do all the things that you think should be done, but that’s the nature of life. And if you live in Washington, as some of us have for a time, you basically become less optimistic over time about being successful. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, sure. I think you were in Congress at a pretty amazing time, too, in terms of all the issues that came up and the things that got done. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, the issues—they’re big issues now. The Senator was involved in the full range of issues, obviously, and had to vote on them all. The legislative staff was charged with making sure that on every vote he had the background he needed, even if it wasn’t an issue he was familiar with. So that was really our job. You can pick out the issues where we spent more time, but if you look at our day-to-day involvement, we were charged with keeping him informed. That’s a tough responsibility in any case. The Senator’s attention was always being pulled—they had a political life too, which is something we haven’t discussed, that is, periodic elections. Certainly it was not as though Senator Weicker was fundraising the day after he was elected for his next campaign, which I think is the case now, but he still spent a good deal of time, the last essentially two years of each term involved in his campaigning also. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How did that then interact with the work you were doing? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, we had to be careful, obviously, not to involve the staff that was in Washington in direct campaigning. But I actually have something that I wanted to refer to. October 1, 1976, so that was an election year. This is a memo that I gave to the legislative assistant at the time about the Senator’s legislative record as it might have affected the residents of Mystic, Connecticut, which suggests to me that he was campaigning in Mystic, Connecticut, at some point. But the issues in the memo were on fisheries management, coastal zone management, lobster conservation, whale conservation, Save the Whales Act, commercial fisheries assistance, commitment to oceans policies. So I was giving legislative background that would be available to the Senator. Now, this had nothing to do with campaigning, and this is public record, but that’s an example.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of briefing him. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes, just briefing him on issues that he’s been involved in, just so he’s aware of it. Obviously, lobster conservation was in issue. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>For Mystic.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>For Mystic. But that’s an example of how we interacted carefully with campaigns by making sure that he could make the points about what he had done. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. Now, are there other things that you have brought with you that you’d like to talk about today?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I’ve been ranging too far. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>But I want to be sure I answer your questions. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In a roundabout way I think you’ve addressed a lot of what we had on this sheet. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I just want to be helpful. So whatever you want to ask, I’m happy to— </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="011322"></a>1:13:22</p>
          <p class="c-header">Briefing Senator Weicker on issues</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I certainly appreciate that, and I think you have been very helpful in terms of talking about the process as you understand it. Can I ask you to talk a little bit about the overlap, as you see it, between the issues that you worked on? You obviously had responsibility for keeping multiple issues going, but did you view them as separate and distinct issues, or do you see how, let’s say, environment and oceans issues overlap with transportation, overlap with small business, etc.? Did you see at the time those interrelationships? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Perhaps another way of looking at it is, on any particular issue you might approach it in the same way, and that is to make sure that you had somebody on staff or off staff who could give you the expertise you need, the background. And make sure that you put together the briefing materials for the Senator so that whether he was having a meeting or testifying before a committee, or making a speech on the floor, that he was well informed and could make a good presentation. </p>
          <p>I did come across a memo that I can show you that indicates how oceans policy in 1976 was divided among staff, and somehow even though I was on the Commerce Committee, I was still involved with organizing staff functions. This would’ve been something where I kept my hand in because the Commerce Committee was involved in a number of these issues, but also I was trying to make sure that we were well organized so we covered as much as we could. What this says is that a number of folks, including Bob Wicklund, had specific responsibilities, and in the end tried to make sure that everyone had the proper access to the Senator and got information to him, and that we could respond to constituents also. So that’s just something that I ran into. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>If I could just follow up on this a little bit. This is a fascinating—I wish we could read it all into the record, but what I see here is a subject that’s called Commerce/Oceans staff, preliminary organization. Most of the responsibilities, as I read this document very quickly, have to do with issues of oceans and marine life, etc. Yet I’ve read in some of the other documentation that the Small Business Administration, the Small Business Committees, were very involved, let’s say, with issues relating to the ocean—fisheries and things of that sort, particularly in Connecticut. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, I think they could’ve been in a fairly direct way providing financing to fisherman, boats, and so forth. I’m not saying they weren’t involved, I’m just saying that one of the problems you have is there are so many issues. How do you cover them? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Exactly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>As Senator Weicker gained more seniority, he was able to take on more committees, more important committees and have staff on them. One of the issues that you have in that situation is coordinating the efforts on any particular issue between your legislative staff and the various committees. And it may be, for example, at this time you had a legislative assistant in the Senator’s office, you had staff reporting to Weicker from the Small Business Committee, that also the Commerce Committee, and there are overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities. Somebody has to coordinate it, and that’s just an example. In some cases we had to sit down and say, “All right, you’re going to do this, you’re going to do that, and then you report through here and we’re going to get it done.” It’s complicated, but like any organization, it’s not any more complicated than perhaps an academic department at a university. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m not sure of that. I’m not sure of that at all. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>But it’s an example of what we had to cover, things which had importance to the Senator. It’s one of the things that we did. This was the letter that indicated what my role was going to be. A letter to Senator Weicker, July 31, 1975, from Senator Pearson, who I’ve mentioned. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The man in Commerce. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>The minority staff person who has been recommended and approved to be integrated into the core minority staff, that has become one of his staff, [reads from document] “…will be assigned principal duties so as to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the association with the Senator originally recommending the staff appointment. Thus, in your case, Geoffrey Baker will be assigned as his principal function responsibilities concerning environment, service transportation, and so forth…” it goes on. </p>
          <p>The way they worked this was I was technically on the Committee staff, but they recognize that I was loyal to and would be reporting to my Senator. So it worked out well. It refers to Mary’s position as also being a member of the Committee too. You had mentioned that and how that came up. </p>
          <p>Then here’s a memo later that year, in September 1975, that I wrote to Bob Herrema, who was the administrative assistant, and Bob Dotchin at Small Business. It basically just says that the subject is Commerce Committee setup to clarify my position that I will focus my activities on my assigned areas and responsibilities for the minority: Surface Transportation and Environment Subcommittees. And also take an active interest in issues of interest to the Senator that come before the Committee. So I was available to work with him on any issues that came up, and help with presentations, and I was a resource. </p>
          <p>So I’m just trying to explain. Not that I was any more important than anyone else, and this refers to Mary. Mary as our S. Res. 60 staff person—that’s the classification—will physically reside in room 342, which was a committee room, and act as a liaison between the Senator’s office and the committee, and she will work on legislative correspondence and other issues. So I had my legislative responsibilities, and she had hers. We were all part of the same team, and I think Lowell Weicker thought of us as a team. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is actually very interesting, because yesterday when I was talking with Bill Shure, he was talking about the fact that he was assigned to Fred Thompson, who was the counsel for the Watergate. The way it’s often written up both in the press and the way Lowell Weicker talks about it is that he was half time working for the Senator and half time for Thompson, but the way Bill Shure explains it, there was really no conflict here. They were all working on the same issues here. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes, and really they all worked well together, generally. Have you interviewed Mary MacAuliffe? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, this isn’t a very good picture, but here’s a picture actually in Weicker’s office of Mary MacAuliffe. You can’t really see—and this is Mike Scully, who was press assistant at one point. I still run into Mary. I saw her over Christmas this last year. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So she’s somebody you think I should interview for sure. Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Oh yes. I mean if you have time. I don’t want to be—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, no. I think this is helpful in the process too, just to hear from others about their perceptions of who were the most important people. Is she in Washington? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I think she’s still in Washington. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I’m not exactly sure where. Anyway, I’ll just mention a couple things because you asked about these all— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Great. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>As I indicated, I was technically working for Senator Pearson, and he’s from Kansas, so as I was the Surface Transportation Subcommittee essentially, on September 14, 1976, he went to Wichita, Kansas, and gave a presentation at a public hearing for the ICC [Interstate Commerce Commission]. It was about rail transportation in Kansas. And so I would write up, essentially, his speech. Now, essentially he believed in the same things that Lowell Weicker did and he was a moderate Republican, and actually I really liked him. I was happy to do what was assigned to me by Senator Pearson, to write a speech. Then he went out there and delivered it. That’s sort of what we did, and then we had signings of rail legislation at the White House. But it was an interesting time whatever issue you worked on if you were in really involved in it. You were often invited to the White House when they signed the legislation.</p>
          <p>I ran across some other issues that I had been involved in. In 1976, this again through Commerce, wholesale electric rate regulation. I spent a great of time writing up the Electric Utilities Rate Reform Act of 1975 to totally revamp utility rate structures. Now, this is a reprint from the <span class="work-title">Congressional Record</span> of Weicker’s presentation. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Which you wrote. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I would’ve written for him and edited for him. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>You think about the range of issues; it’s not as though I’m an expert in any of this stuff now. But if I’d been smart, I would’ve taken this and gone to a law firm in Washington and become the wholesale electric rate regulation guru of Washington, but I didn’t do that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you had a fascinating career by virtue of doing that too, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>And here in 1975 a letter from Gerald Ford thanking me for my work on the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which came to the Commerce Committee, and somehow I had been assigned to work on that. Anyway, so— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So did working on these issues very intensively give you a level of expertise, which you then took with you after you left? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I wish I could say that, because I don’t think I’ve managed my career properly. Most of my friends with whom I worked up there, and now know, went on to either work in law firms or in other government agencies, and when I left the Hill, I went essentially to work for myself and with the others doing venture capital and private equity investing. I’ve been doing that for the last 30 years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What did you learn about leadership from working with Lowell Weicker and experiencing the work of others on the Hill? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, I think he was a strong leader and he inspired leadership. He could be prickly and difficult, but we all can. So he wasn’t perfect. I learned a lot from him about inspiring people to get things done, which is something I’ve always respected. I’m still involved in organizations and I work with people, and I’m still in a position where I’m trying to get things done. Relying on other people, so I think that’s essential.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And how do you inspire people to get things done? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I try to convince them that it’s important to get it done. But I think that one of the things that I take, and I’m sure we all took from working as we did as young people in those settings, is that you really have to have teamwork to get anything done. You have to have consensus to get votes on the floor, and your Senators have to work together, but to get anything to the floor you need teamwork at a staff level. And that means you have to be willing to work across the aisle and you have to convince your opponents either not to oppose you as strongly or you have to neutralize them in some way. </p>
          <p>It’s not all about winning hearts and minds. It’s very often strategic. But if you just take as an example trying to get one piece of legislation through from conception to passage, and funding, as you obviously know, is a very complicated process and it involves a lot of people. Whenever you’re involved with a lot of people you have the potential to be derailed at any turn. Most of what I work with involves investors, entrepreneurs, bankers, and so forth. I work with a lot of people even though I’m not part of a large organization, and what I learned from my experience on the Hill has been extremely valuable in terms of getting things done. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Lowell Weicker certainly comes across as a pretty passionate person. Whatever he takes on, he’s very passionate, and I wonder if some of his leadership skills have to be able to transfer that passion down the line and make people really feel that what he believes in is worth believing in. And therefor they would work for— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, I think that’s a very good way of thinking of it. Whether or not that works for all of us, I don’t know. Yes, you’re projecting passion, but it has to be received in a way that you respect the principle behind the passion and everything else. So yes. If you can make a good strong case passionately, as he often did, I think, you have a good chance of garnering the kind of support you need and inspiring those around you to further the cause. I can say that to the extent I’ve been able to follow that model, I’ve been successful. </p>
          <p>I give Senator Weicker a great deal of credit for allowing me to learn a lot about myself and about life at an early age in a difficult setting, and it’s meant a lot to me. Lifelong. Even though unlike many of the people that you talk to I didn’t have an experience that went beyond the first two terms in the Senate, and I haven’t been involved with him directly since then, only as a friend. My wife and I see him and Claudia on occasion. We like them both very much. But for me everything goes back to those early, early years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What do you think he’ll be most remembered for? Or should be most remembered for? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>What’s interesting is that, as I say, I have a number of friends now that are my age. I’m a senior citizen who had experience on the Hill, and they know the difference between then and now. Whenever people ask me what was your experience on the Hill, and who did you work for and so forth and I say Lowell Weicker, he is extremely well regarded by people who have some experience at that time. I’m not sure how many young people know of him, but anyone who was in Washington or around Washington or had anything to do with Washington in the ’70s, for example, thinks very well of him. </p>
          <p>Conservative Republicans today don’t consider him a Republican, and perhaps liberal Democrats don’t consider him liberal enough. So he’s still somewhere in the middle, but the reputation he has with the folks of my generation who have any experience with Washington is very high. I get credit for that, which is undeserved, but just being associated with him is rewarding. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s accomplishments</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, just to clarify this a little bit. He has written or said in interviews that he thinks that environmental issues and the work that he did on oceanic research and conservation are among the most substantive accomplishments. That is his own self-reflection. I also know that [Joseph] Lieberman ran against him on environmental issues as one of the arguments that he brought. He said he could do a better job, but nonetheless, Senator Weicker on self-reflection feels that this is a very important part of his legacy. Others would say, like Bill Shure with whom I spoke yesterday, and so it’s on the record, that he surely thinks Watergate will be remembered as his most important legacy. Not necessarily substantively, but at least in terms of the public perception. </p>
          <p>Maureen Byrnes, who worked so intensively on the AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] issues, and on issues relating to education and mental retardation, etc., feels very passionately and continues to work on those issues. So there are all these different little areas that he’s remembered for. It seems to me as his legislative assistant who saw so many of the issues run through his office, do you think you would have a good ability to step back and reflect on whether you think any of these are more central than others or should become a more central part of his legacy? Or would you just want to say all of them? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Well, to some extent, all of them for different reasons. I spent most of my time of the period I was up there on transportation issues. I think he had a great deal of impact. Now, as a lasting impact, will people remember him for that? Not necessarily. I’m satisfied that he did have a great deal of impact, but that’s not what I would say he’ll be remembered for. </p>
          <p>We haven’t talked about Watergate that much, except that it was very exciting to be around him and the committee at that time. We felt we were the center of a lot of attention, but he really dug into that, and it was for Senator Weicker, in some ways, a formative experience in terms of establishing his character. Because from that time forward he wasn’t afraid to dig into things, particularly with issues of ethics and so forth, and good government. There was no question that he established his reputation with Watergate, and I think that that’s sort of the beginning. Oceans is an example—I mean he felt passionately about that and he was engaged in it. He got wet. So you know when you do that and you believe in it, it’s central to his life, and yes, I think he had a great deal of impact. Did he transform the world? I don’t know, but he certainly gave it the kind of attention that has kept it alive. </p>
          <p>And generally on environmental issues I think he had a strong record, but I think you’d have to focus on oceans. If you ask me, it was more after my time, but his interest in medical research generally, that’s probably where he’s had the greatest impact. And he was on the Appropriations Committee and he really gave attention to the disabled issues. So if I had to give you one answer, it would be medical research.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In part because he controlled the purse strings. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>Yes. But he was in a position where he could make a difference, and he made a difference. He took on issues that hadn’t gotten a lot of attention, made sure there was funding, and frankly, at the time he was doing it, it was important for AIDS, and for many of the other health issues, and for the disabled in particular. I really believe in what he was doing, and I’m involved in some medical technology research now that is meaningful to me, but I think everything that he did set the stage for a lot of what’s going on now in that area. So I’d give him full marks for that. If anyone wants to argue that he’ll be remembered for Watergate, I would just say yes. But that allowed him to do many of the other things that he did do because he had greater prominence and credibility for those issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That sounds like a very important thing to say. I think that sounds right to me. That it gave him the prominence, the place from which he could then go on and do other things. Thank you very much for doing this. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I hope it’s useful. I wish I had a sharper memory of everything, but it’s interesting to think back, and I just hope it’s useful to the project. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s certainly useful getting as many perspectives on the tape as possible to get an understanding, as much as the process. You’ve certainly filled in some pieces that we didn’t have and that researchers will happy to have, without going through the rows and rows and rows of boxes to try to re-establish some things. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>I think you can go back and research some of these other areas too through the <span class="work-title">Congressional Record</span> and through just general news sources to get a sense of things. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you very much for your time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">G. Baker: </span>You’re very welcome.</p>
