          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is Phyllis Leffler. We are at the offices of Stanley Twardy, Jr., at Day Pitney in Stamford, Connecticut, and today is Sunday, August 8. So, did I get your name right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>You got it right. Stanley Twardy. Correct.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Stanley Twardy, Jr. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Junior, right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay, great. Thanks for doing this for us today. I wanted to start out by just asking you if you would talk a little bit about your own educational background and how it was that you got involved with Lowell Weicker.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000045"></a>0:00:45</p>
          <p class="c-header">Twardy volunteers for Weicker’s Senate re-election campaign</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Yes. I went to Trinity College up in Hartford, graduated in 1973 with a physics major and a math minor and, of course, went to law school at the University of Virginia and graduated from the law school at Virginia in 1976. When I was in law school, it was during the Watergate period, so I was not involved as others were who you’ve talked to—Bill Shure—with the Watergate on behalf of Senator Weicker, but I watched him from afar. </p>
          <p>It was a time where I was probably getting involved politically myself or was involved but really starting to focus on things, watched what had happened with the Saturday Night Massacre at the Justice Department, which obviously for those involved in the law was quite disappointing and concerning. During the course of that time period, Senator Weicker actually came to Virginia for a program that I attended. I don’t recall the year, but it was some time in that time period, and obviously I knew of him from Connecticut. He had been my congressman for the 4th Congressional District in Connecticut in ’68 to ’70. I wasn’t voting at that time. Then he was elected to the Senate for the first time in 1970, so I knew of him, but I did not know him at all.</p>
          <p>I have to say my father, who was born in Poland, was a very strong [Richard] Nixon supporter, and I remember having Sunday dinnertime conversations with my father that got quite heated.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Boy, many of us did in those years, right? [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>And you know, we would talk about Weicker—again, not knowing him, but just it would come up that this was I thought one of the great all-time lines, when then Senator Weicker was talking about Republicans and what Republicans don’t do in the context of spying on individuals and some of the things that the Nixon White House was doing. But in any event, I saw Senator Weicker at this program at the University of Virginia and was quite impressed with him and found that I liked the types of positions he was taking on things. </p>
          <p>I graduated from law school in 1976 and went to work for a firm in Greenwich. At that firm was a lawyer by the name of Tom Hartch. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Would you spell that? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Sure. H-A-R-T-C-H. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>The name of the firm at the time was Hirschberg Pettengill. It’s gone through many iterations since. I think now Whitman Breed Abbott is the name of the firm. The legacy has carried on there, but Tom was the lawyer for Senator Weicker’s re-election campaign in 1976. I started at the law firm in the fall of 1976. I’d just recently broken up with a girl I’d dated for two years in law school, so I had some free time on my hands, and I volunteered through Tom Hartch to work on Senator Weicker’s campaign.</p>
          <p>Senator Weicker beat Gloria Schaffer that year by a resounding margin. I’d never met him during the course of the campaign until election night, but I did participate in a number of conference calls with him and I think he had a rough idea of who I was, and I remember introducing myself to him election night. And that was it. Sort of things stopped there.</p>
          <p>I will quickly get to how I ended up with him, but that next summer of 1977 there were articles that Senator Weicker might run for President. I was working for this firm in Greenwich, which is where Senator Weicker was living at the time, and I sent him a note saying that I see that you might be running for President. I’d be happy to volunteer on your campaign. Little did I know that Senators don’t usually read their own mail. I sort of had a view of Washington and the Senate being Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, but what happened is the confluence of two things. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000452"></a>0:04:52</p>
          <p class="c-header">Twardy hired as lawyer for Senate Small Business Committee</p>
          <p>One, because my letter did mention the senatorial campaign, Pete Kinsey, who’s since passed away but was Senator Weicker’s chief of staff, read the mail and read the letter and showed it to the Senator, and secondly, at that time, Senator Weicker had just become the ranking Republican on the Senate Small Business Committee and they needed a lawyer for the Committee. Again, this letter happened to go across his desk at the same time that there was an opening on his staff. </p>
          <p>I got a call out of the blue from Senator Weicker’s secretary one evening, and I’ve told this story, but I want to tell it for this, about how I responded. I was on the phone with a partner at a large firm and saw the light blinking. This was before they had call waiting and the like. They had receptionists, and after my call was over I called up and got the message that Senator Weicker’s office was on the phone. I thought it was a joke being played by one of my friends. I heard this voice come on the phone, a secretary. “Hi, please hold for Senator Weicker.” It sounded just like my friend’s secretary, and before I could say something like, “Hey, Lowell, how the F— are you?” which is what I was thinking, I heard this voice come on the line which was clearly Senator Weicker’s voice.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s hard to mistake.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Hard to mistake a voice, yes, and after I recovered, he basically asked if I’d be interested in applying for the position. I really did not know much about what the Small Business Committee did other than I’d just seen something in the paper that there was a battle over something at the SBA [Small Business Administration] and really hadn’t distinguished between the two of them. The long and short of it is I went down that next day for an interview, was offered a job, and two weeks later started working for Senator Weicker. I’m proud and honored to say it’s been 33 years in which I’ve had a very good friend and a wonderful mentor and just one of the most fortunate things to happen to me in my life.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you started working for him in ’77?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Yes, October of 1977.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And did you resign from your law firm? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Yes. Well there was— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>There was no leave of absence.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>No, no, so I left the law firm. I worked as his counsel on the Senate Small Business Committee until early 1979, and at that time I went downstairs, so to speak. The Senator’s main office was on the third floor of the Russell Senate Office Building, and the Small Business Committee staff was on the fourth floor, so we talked about upstairs and downstairs. So if I lapse into downstairs or upstairs, the downstairs, the main floor, is the Senator’s personal staff. I became his counsel, and it really was to work on issues that came up. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>All issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>All issues. I had no specific committee that I covered, no specific issues that I covered. </p>
          <p>Some of the things I got involved in were privacy matters, tax issues, the Ethics &amp; Government Act, so-called Special Prosecutor legislation that arose out of Watergate, and this was a time period just a few years after Watergate that issues were starting to come back as to the tensions between the executive branch, the legislative branch. The media were still playing out post-Watergate and it was a fascinating place to be, but it was also the country—after having President Nixon resign, President Gerald Ford take over, electing Jimmy Carter in 1976, the country was starting to come back to the right a bit. There was a malaise, so to speak, with what had happened in Iran, and a little bit more advocates for more power in the executive branch were coming out. People were concerned about things having gone too far in the Watergate and some of the reforms, so there were attempts to beat back those reforms, and I got involved with a number of those.</p>
          <p>Also, the Chrysler bailout in December of 1979, which was an interesting issue. It sort of presaged what we saw, we’ve seen, with TARP [Troubled Assets Relief Program] recently, but it was one that the Senator opposed on the grounds of basically being a true Republican, which is, the free market system awards those who succeed and not those who fail, and interestingly, although as he put it to me when we were chatting about this recently, he said he was wrong in that Chrysler actually did pay the money back. The principle that he was standing for was right because it was only another 30 years later that Chrysler and others were back for another bailout, and you wonder whether or not if the government had done something differently in 1977 we’d see something different now.</p>
          <p>And the last thing, and there’re a number of different things, as you say—tax, privacy, other matters that I was fortunate enough to work on, but just as I was leaving him in December of 1980, and this actually started before the elections in which Ronald Reagan was named President, but the issues on busing, or as we called it, the Senator called it, “court stripping,” basically the executive branch coming in to try to strip courts of power, and that came up as they say toward the end of 1980. Then there was a lame duck session into December of 1980 in which that whole issue was fought, as I say, on the busing, and that was sort of my—I was the point person then. </p>
          <p>I left in December of 1980. I told Senator Weicker in the spring that I wanted to go back and practice law, and I did, although it was very hard to do so. I did go back and practice law, but I was there at the cutting edge. I like to flatter myself at least to think that I was helpful in trying to come up with a strategy to attack this court stripping, and remember how at the time that the language that we were able to come up with or I was able to come up with, this was all being done in the context of funding those appropriations bills for State, Justice &amp; Commerce Committees, and part of State, Justice &amp; Commerce Committees, the appropriations for that, were the appropriations for the courts. Senator Jesse Helms and others were putting restrictions on what the courts could do with the money that was being given to them. </p>
          <p>We came up at this time period with some language to add to the legislation that had passed with the anti-busing language on it, and the amendment read, “Nothing in this act shall be interpreted to limit in any manner the Department of Justice in its enforcing the Constitution of the United States, nor shall anything in this act be interpreted to modify or diminish the authority of the courts of the United States to enforce fully the Constitution of the United States.” </p>
          <p>And first, that amendment actually had won in the fall before the elections. We actually picked up Senators who had originally voted for the anti-busing language, who, when they read the language about “Nothing here shall keep the courts or the Department of Justice from enforcing the Constitution,” didn’t realize what that language basically did was to say, okay, since the busing is basically a remedy for a constitutional violation, notwithstanding the fact it said there can’t be any busing, this language negated it, and that sort of set the stage for how the Senator phrased the issue. As you know, so much in politics is how issues are phrased, and this was over this time period through the end of the fall and early winter, fall and December of 1980, when this all took place. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. So you were involved in almost every constitutional issue during that period of time.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>During that time period. Even though I went to private practice for a number of years, I stayed involved with the Senator and with the staff, and some of the stuff I was just showing you was sent to me. I’m looking here at something in 1982 and ’83 by Geoff Baker and others, and stayed very actively with the Senator on policy matters until, at his recommendation, Ronald Reagan nominated me to be the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, which I became in 1985, and ironically, one of the key staffers for Jesse Helms on the busing matter became the U.S. Attorney in North Carolina at the same time that I became U.S. Attorney in Connecticut, so we were able to, as we said, be on the same team at that time. [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>With the same goals.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Yes, to enforce the laws of the United States. We didn’t get back into the constitutional remedies in our discussions there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. Okay. So you stay involved. Obviously, you’re the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, so you’re engaged and involved in some ways with Lowell Weicker I’m sure during those years, but then you come on more directly later on as his chief of staff.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>After he was elected, I had a ten-year gap. I left his Senate employ in December 1980. Lowell was elected Governor of the state of Connecticut in 1990. He’d lost to Senator [Joseph] Lieberman for re-election in 1988—now Senator Lieberman—and after two years ran as an Independent, won the gubernatorial position here in Connecticut. </p>
          <p>I loved the job of U.S. Attorney. I have to say that it was the best job I ever had. The Senator, Governor Weicker, did convince me to leave, and it turned out to be a great move for me also, but I went back and served as his chief of staff from January of 1991 until the spring of 1993, when I left to return to private practice.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did I read that there was a joint chief of staff situation?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>In 1991, Tom D’Amore and I were co-chiefs of staff, and then in ’92 and into early ’93 I was the sole chief of staff, and the issue we had then, of course, in 1991 was the income tax, but we also had— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We’ll talk about that later. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>But we also had the issue of Indian gaming in Connecticut and got involved working with the Senator there to strike what ended up being the one of its kind in the country where the Mashantucket Pequots at first have to pay a percentage of the proceeds from their gaming facilities here in Connecticut, as now. Then ultimately the Mohegans who followed them, and it was just, again, working with then Governor Weicker coming up with some shrewd ways of helping the state. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay, well thank you for laying all that out. That really gives us some framework and guideposts for maybe getting into the issues just a little bit more. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001730"></a>0:17:30</p>
          <p class="c-header">Issues handled by the Small Business Committee</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you start out initially to work on issues pertaining to the Small Business Committee. What were some of the issues that came before the Small Business Committee that were in your mind particularly significant and particularly significant for Lowell Weicker’s career?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Sure, I think a couple of them. Again, one is looking at the backdrop of where we are today. You know, it’s funny how history repeats itself, but the whole issue of what we call capital formation, how you help businesses grow, therefore providing jobs for folks. It was really in his position as chair of the Small Business Committee that he took the fight, or he was actually the ranking Republican who took the fight on the Chrysler bailout, which was, “We’re going to give this money to prop up a big company, but we’re not helping smaller companies that actually are bringing more back as far as job creation” and the like. That was a very big issue at the time. Jimmy Carter actually had a White House conference on small business, and we were very active with Bob Dotchin, the Republican staff director, who was very involved in that whole issue of jobs and the economy. </p>
          <p>Also, credit reporting was another one that Senator Weicker used that committee for, and, again, these committees have certain names, but what one needs to look at is what is the jurisdiction of these committees. Some of the other things that the Senator used it for was credit information, credit reporting. Again, we’re seeing that come up in a strange way, but this was as much about privacy, making sure that individuals’ credit scores are being reported accurately. </p>
          <p>He looked at pharmaceutical companies and what was happening as far as patents, and again, we’re still seeing this issue play out now with patents and when they become public, when you can start using the generics, and as now, pharmaceutical companies sometimes in the context of litigation over patent rights will come up with agreements that will extend the timeliness of the exclusivity of a patent. There were those types of issues then and they were interesting, because the Senator was on one side and Gaylord Nelson, the Democratic chair of the Committee, was on the other, so we had some good issues there.</p>
          <p>Also at the time, an issue was coming over Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I forgot that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>The issues there were whether or not the church was using its nonprofit status to gain unfair competitive advantage in a number of different areas. One was in the whole fishing industry. They were involved in fishing, and that led to me taking a trip to Kodiak Island and to Seattle and the west coast to investigate. Obviously we were getting documents and the like and financial papers, but talking to people about whether or not the church was able to, as the parent of a business—they had a number of different businesses—have an unfair competitive advantage against the for-profit, basically, many of them family-owned fishing companies. So that was another of the issues that the Senator used.</p>
          <p>The other one was we dealt with Amtrak funding, and again, you may recall that right before I started working for the Senator, I think it was ’75, ’76, they had the oil embargoes. I remember when I was in law school my parents coming down from Connecticut to visit me in Charlottesville and having to make sure that they drove on the right day of the week because certain days, odd-numbered days and even-numbered days, you were allowed to or not allowed to get gasoline. I think that went into the early 1977 time period, but that was an issue out there and one that the Senator was able to use his position on the Small Business Committee to get into issues, because it also dealt with gasoline. How do you conserve energy, taking cars off the road and the like through mass transportation.</p>
          <p>I really had a wonderful time working with him, even though I was the Republican lawyer for the Senate Small Business Committee and obviously reported to and developed relationships with Orrin Hatch, who was on the Committee, Dewey Bartlett, who was from Oklahoma who was on the Committee and would work with them, but my primary boss was Senator Weicker, and as I say we were able, which shows to me his genius, to get involved beyond the four corners of what one would think with the Senate Small Business Committee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That was really a question I wanted to explore with you because we just have a lot of information from the archival materials of details related to the rail system and Amtrak somehow flowing through the Small Business Committee, and I wasn’t quite sure—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>That’s probably all my handwriting that you’re seeing there. [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Perhaps. I wasn’t really quite sure of how one makes the connections between Conrail and Amtrak, and I’m not really sure, I think it was during your time on the Committee that that there was this issue about the Montrealer.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>That’s exactly right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So what is the connection there between rail service between the northeast and Montreal and small business? Why did it flow through Small Business?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>You’d have to ask the Senator this. I think it flowed through there because even before I became his counsel, I was starting to serve that role. If there were issues that came up, given my legal background, it was something I think he would reach out to me from the pure jurisdictional point of view. And as you said, it was not just Amtrak but it was also Conrail in the use of the rails to benefit small businesses, whether it’s transporting goods, workers, and the like would have been what the nexus would be for that. </p>
          <p>Now, the Montrealer was a train that ran from Vermont ultimately to Washington, and it was a train that a number of people—it was very important for folks in Connecticut to have access to get to Vermont through this train that Amtrak was looking to cut out of the system, and I have to say unfortunately I forget the name of the individual, a constituent here in Connecticut, who was very actively involved in this, but I met with him and talked about how it would impact his business as he tried to, as his sales people were going to sell things. They were using the trains to go do that on Conrail and, again, 33 years later, the nuance of this I must say has escaped me a bit, but the transportation of goods sort of piggybacks off of what Amtrak was doing.</p>
          <p>With Amtrak, you basically had federal funds going into the states, and if the rail service was being not only maintained but improved—for example, many years later, what brought us Acela—but by upgrading the rail systems here for Amtrak, the goods haulers would also be benefited from those track improvements, which would then help businesses get their supplies. </p>
          <p>Again, before my time, Senator Weicker was very involved, and I think this was as congressman, then as a Senator, when the Metro North was set up here following the bankruptcy of Penn—I’ve forgotten. I’m drawing a blank on the name, but it was the rail system that went bankrupt, which was ultimately converted into Metro North. But again, that was people doing work, getting from one point, Connecticut or wherever it might be, into New York. The Montrealer was up to Vermont, and that was the tie-in there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In general, what do you see as the Senator’s larger interests in the Small Business Committee? Do you think he has a philosophical orientation or that he wanted to accomplish specific things by being on that committee or—?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>I think one of the things, as one looks back at his career and how in 1988 he was defeated basically by the Republican base abandoning him—again, you have to look at the actual numbers, but as I recall, President [George H.W.] Bush won election in Connecticut by 10,000 or 20,000 votes. Senator Weicker lost to the Democrat Lieberman by 10,000 votes, and there were 20,000 to 30,000 fewer voters on the Senate side than the presidential, and so those who voted Republican for President might not necessarily have voted for Joe Lieberman, but they weren’t voting for Lowell Weicker.</p>
          <p>At that time, he was seen, I think, as being against some of the Reagan revolution, and indeed, part of that was after my time. But when he, Senator [Robert] Stafford and [Charles McCurdy “Mac”] Mathias and [Jacob] Javits and others, the Gang of Five, really got involved in this. You’ll be talking about this with Kim Elliott because she was really involved with this, where the moderate Republican Senators in the Reagan years held the key votes on a number of issues. </p>
          <p>So whether it was the Republicans or the Democrats, they would have to reach to them on issues, and unlike all too often today what we’re seeing on this is that these five or six Senators were able to use their positions and the closeness of what was going on to effectuate things. As I say, you’ll talk more with Kim about it, but some of the school busing and these other individual liberty issues came up during that time period where the Gang of Five was able to come together.</p>
          <p>What I was going to say is that Senator Weicker was truly a Republican and a believer in the free enterprise system. His opposition to the Chrysler bailout, for example, that was not the invisible hand getting involved. That was the hand of government getting involved in things and through the Small Business Committee by—one of the things that makes business work is competition, and where does competition come from? It comes from, as we’ve seen now, again, 30 years later, from the Googles or from the various Web-based companies. It comes from start-ups, from individuals who have ideas, and the Bill Gates’ of the world who have ideas and somehow are able to find financing for it. </p>
          <p>We were talking earlier about the whole idea of capital formation, all those issues. How could government, how could Senator Weicker use his position to make sure not that the scales were tipped in favor of small businesses, but that they weren’t tipped against? That it’s so hard for an emerging business to find the capital, especially today in 2010 with what’s going on with the economy, but even in that time period—how could he, Senator Weicker, make sure there was a level playing field for those start-ups that ultimately would be the competition? Again, we were talking about the pharmaceutical industry, the same thing. Where is the next Pfizer coming from? That’s the type of thing. His grandfather was involved the Squibb family, so that’s something that he understood and he knew.</p>
          <p>One thing about Senator Weicker, and the same thing as Governor Weicker, as Lowell Weicker, let me put it that way, is there’s consistency.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s exactly what I wanted to ask you. Do you see consistency on these issues throughout—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Throughout his career. One of the things that I remember going home to my parents early on in my career working for the Senator, I don’t know if it was the first time I was home. I started on Columbus Day in 1977. I think I was home for Thanksgiving. I don’t know if it was Thanksgiving or Christmas when I said this to my parents, but I remember it clearly: The Lowell Weicker that you saw on TV was the Lowell Weicker that you’d have a drink with, and it was the same person. </p>
          <p>Even in that short time period, and I won’t get into names of some of the Senators, but there were people that you would see who would be saying one thing on the floor of the Senate, something else on TV or whatever, and then you’d talk to them and it wasn’t a firmly held belief. It was a politically expedient belief, and again, the core of Lowell Weicker is he had firmly held beliefs and he said all along it’s the public’s job. He’s working for the public. This is who I am. These are the beliefs that I believe. If you disagree, I shouldn’t be your Senator. He wasn’t tacking to get re-elected as we see people now amazingly. It’s time for election, let’s go and placate those who we need their votes, as opposed to saying, “Okay, this is what I am, this is what I stand for.” Lowell Weicker on all these issues was consistent. </p>
          <p>If you get into—well, I don’t know if you’ve, oh yes, you did say you talked to Maureen Byrnes and others, but health care issues, disabled rights, rights of the mentally or physically disabled. His positions are consistent, and there’s something that I will never forget, during the time of this [Jesse] Helms issue on busing in October, November, December of 1980, going with Lowell and his wife to see Sonny [Weicker]. Sonny had some sort of health problems. Sonny, as you know, is his Down’s child. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>At the time he was having problems with his ears and went to the Children’s Hospital, I believe it is, in Washington, and when we were there, a constituent from Connecticut introduced himself to Lowell. Their young child was with them who had a serious form of cancer and it was a last gasp for them. I remember them talking, and I’m getting goose bumps just talking about this now as a father, about how they had been referred to this hospital, that their child was two years old. It turned out to be a fatal cancer, but this was the first time they had some hope, and I remember walking out of that hospital with Lowell and him turning to me and saying, “That’s what a Senator should be doing, should be helping people, not aggrandizing themselves, not keeping things from happening, but should be helping people.” </p>
          <p>That’s what Lowell was about. What you saw was what you got with him, but it was using that position to help people. I think as you’re picking up from the archives as you are doing, from the conversations you’re having with people, I think that’s a consistency that you’ll see in what he did as a Senator, and the same thing as a Governor. </p>
          <p>When we were doing the budget that led to the income tax being proposed, there were lots of things that we cut. Since we’re talking about the Senate papers, I won’t get into all the statistics that I could give you about how much more was done in cuts, how Connecticut had a bigger deficit percentage-wise than California did, all the things we did. But some of the sacrosanct things for the Senator, Governor I should say at the time, were programs to help those who did not have, as he put it, “a voice in the capital,” did not have the lobbyists, and if you think about it, those are the people for whom government is most important. The way government has evolved, they have no voice in how laws are passed and what is being done for them, and that’s a consistent theme of Lowell Weicker’s life. </p>
          <p>Justice. You notice in this file I have, what do I have? The Constitution. That’s something. I have one in my briefcase day in and day out, and my daughter, when she was young, she said, “Dad, why do you carry a Constitution?” “Courtney [Twardy], I’ve been doing it ever since I was working for Uncle Governor Lowell when he was Senator Weicker.” It’s something that was very important, you know, that we’re a nation of laws, not of men. That’s a consistent theme that you’ll see for Lowell Weicker, too—we’re a nation of laws, not of men, and the Constitution is the key law. </p>
          <p>Today’s <span class="work-title">New York Times</span> has an interesting story about the [Christopher] Dodd-[Barney] Frank bill. This is financial reform legislation, and there’s a great line by the author. He said Dodd-Frank is 834 pages, or at least the electronic version of it is. The Constitution was four pages, and of course they parenthetically say they wrote small then, but the difference between a document that has lasted forever—now, obviously you’ve had a number of the amendments with the Bill of Rights that came along with it, but those principles were something that was very important for Lowell, and whenever we had positions, whether I was his staffer in the Senate or as Governor, there were—“What are the principles? What is this about? What is this?” </p>
          <p>The other thing that came through to me with him, and it’s something I’ve shared with others who have gone on to bigger and better offices from when they were state legislators, a comment Lowell made, which was, “Good government is good politics.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Maureen Byrnes in the interview I did with her also emphasized his commitment to the Constitution and constitutional principles. He has emphasized that to me. I guess as we all know we are a government of laws, not of men, but it takes men to interpret the laws, and so that’s really the rub— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—because some of these laws can be interpreted in multiple ways.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>And you know, a scary thing is I can remember in one piece of legislation being with a group of Senators and there was a quibble. Quibble’s the wrong word. There was a debate over what words to use and some Senator said, “Well, why don’t we just leave this up to the courts to decide?” It happened to be a Republican Senator who didn’t like the idea of the activist courts deciding what legislation meant, at least in some of the things that he was saying, and that was not Lowell, which was, “I want it to be very clear what I mean here,” so no, you are right. It’s a question of interpretation, but in the constitutional issue debates we had when I was working for the Senator in Washington, I remember going to Congressional Research Service a lot and getting research work done on what story or some of the other original commentators on the Constitution wrote back at the time. </p>
          <p>I got to know [Alexis] de Tocqueville quite well having worked for the Senator because of de Tocqueville’s discussion on America and the writings of Thomas Jefferson. One of the common bonds between Lowell and myself, the University of Virginia, and Jefferson and the things he spoke for. I don’t think it’d be fair to say that Weicker was a Jeffersonian. There are certain things that the two of them would’ve disagreed on, but there’re certain basic tenets that clearly they did agree on, and the whole issue, again, of school prayer, which I throw in with the busing bit because it was the court stripping. This was the way to—courts can’t tell people you can’t pray in school type of issues, but those types of things when Jefferson was talking about the wall between the church and the state, that’s a principle that you would hear.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He believes in that, I know. It’s really important.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>And interestingly, that was Jefferson writing to the Baptists in Danbury, Connecticut. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>So as a Senator from Connecticut, that became something that Lowell was very familiar with.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’d like you to talk a little bit about how his office worked on a day-to-day basis in terms of the relationship between you as a staffer and legislative aide and counsel, I guess both during those years that you were involved in the Senate and also as Governor. How did he in a practical way communicate with members of his staff and have people work together?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Two different things between the Senate and Governor. A lot more staff for the Governor because you have all the agencies and the like, so maybe we’ll come back to that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Excellent. <br>
          </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="004146"></a>0:41:46</p>
          <p class="c-header">Organization of Weicker’s Senate staff</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>In the Senate, there’s a relatively small number of staffers. They were split between his personal staff, the Small Business Committee staff, and the Appropriations staff, the Appropriations Committee. And as I was saying earlier, as chair of the Small Business Committee or as chair of the State, Justice, Commerce, and then also he was HEW, Health, Education &amp; Welfare HHS [Department of Health and Human Services], Subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>He had staff that reported to him, even though they worked for all the Republican Senators, but de facto the way the game was played was the ranking Republican or the chair of the Committee, the staff really worked for them and they were named by him, so the Senator had these different committees that had staffers on and he would have different people assigned to cover different issues, but then also he would make sure that if there were ways to leverage staff on something, if some issue had cut across a couple of areas that were State, Justice, Commerce, Appropriations Committee, if there was also a Small Business issue, can we combine staffs and work on those? So his style—</p>
          <p>He did not have as a Senator weekly staff meetings. He met regularly with, again, during my time period there, Geoff Baker was the chief of staff, Bob Dotchin was the ranking Republican on the Small Business Committee, and then Bob Wicklund was working on the Appropriations Committee for him because of—NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] was under State, Justice, Commerce. John Doyle came later. John Doyle came in after I left and Maureen Byrnes came after I left because when the Republicans took control of the Senate, he ended up with more committees and more staff. So primarily when I was there, it was the State, Justice, Commerce Committee, Small Business Committee, and the personal staff, and the Senator would have—there were five or six key people. </p>
          <p>Peter Goldfarb, who was an accountant, Peter was really Lowell’s financial guy. He covered Appropriations Committee. He understood the dollars and cents. And it would be one that if there was a Justice issue, as a lawyer, sometimes I’d get involved and help out on things, just internally, but it was key staff members. And periodically, Lowell would have meetings in which we’d meet at this point in my office. Lots of times it would be at his house, you know, let’s get together and talk about this, and we’d do a lot of that. He was very involved. We had an office softball team, Weicker’s Whalers, that played, and that was a way that all the staff would get together and we would mix with each other. </p>
          <p>He was hands-on. He was the issue spotter because he’d be the one who would be in the Senate caucuses or he’d be having lunch with other Senators and he’d find out what issues were on. He was very good at keeping his ear to the ground as to what issues were out there and would then get staff involved as appropriate on matters.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How much autonomy did you feel you had in working on a variety of issues?  Did you feel that you were implementing very concrete goals or initiatives that he had started, or were you in a position on some of these issues to recommend to him the direction that you thought—?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>I think both. I think that clearly there were some, especially when I was new there. I mean when I first started there I was very reactive and I certainly felt no autonomy whatsoever. It was, this is what I had to do and sort of had to report back to the principal. Not the principal, the teacher. But as the teacher got to know me better and I got to know the teacher better, I think there were areas there. If I saw potential issues because I’d be talking to staffers, I would then come back. </p>
          <p>It worked two ways. The Senator at the Senate level and we as staff at the staff level, if we saw potential issues, or if we saw potential resolutions, I think that he was very good at listening to his staff on matters. He was very opinionated. He was not one who was led by the staff. You’ve talked to him, so you know that that’s not at all Lowell Weicker, but he is one that I always felt comfortable coming to him with proposals. Some he accepted. Some he rejected outright. Some he I thought rejected, but I’d hear about it at some point later on.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It percolated.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>It percolated, yes, and so let me just talk again. I think I alluded to this a little bit. That one of the things, the genius of Lowell Weicker, and it’s been very helpful to me. As I said, I was a physics major and a math minor. I’m a lawyer. I’m very linear. As my wife complains all the time, I’m very linear and logical. Lowell thinks outside the box. He has a way of not being hidebound by preconceived notions or a preconceived way of doing it, and I just was amazed at his ability to come at an issue from left field. </p>
          <p>But going back to what we talked about earlier, consistent with his principles on something, it’s left field from us who’re sitting here, but because he started with a principle, it would then flow very logically as to where it’s going to go, whereas I think we as staffers, I as a staffer sometimes would start off as, Okay, here’s the issue—and this is the physicist or the mathematician in me—how do you solve the issue? As opposed to Lowell, which was: This is the answer, how do we get there?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Holding onto the big picture all the time.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Correct. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He does seem to be very capable of doing that and not at all fearful as so many politicians are of saying a particularly strong thing to get the public to understand what his principle is.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Phyllis, you’re exactly right with that, and thank you, because it reminds me of something that I remember with him on times where he would take positions which I thought were just provocative. “Lowell, why are you doing that? I mean, we’re never going to get support with you with that position.” But he was like a chess player. He was seeing steps ahead, and I think he would know, given the constituency of the Senate at the time, what he could conceivably get at the end of the day. </p>
          <p>When he filibustered Chrysler, he knew that he didn’t have the votes to keep the bailout from happening, but there were certain things he wanted to see happen as far as protecting the fisc of the United States in this bailout and certain changes, so he would take a position whether it was on the Chrysler bailout or on many other things, a position that would have no chance of success. But if one looks, and hopefully the archivists as they go through this are looking to see, at the end of the day he affected the ultimate legislation by moving it closer to where he was philosophically, principally, on the matter. It might not have been consistent with what it was, but by taking the position he did, he was able to influence things. </p>
          <p>When you talk with Kim and others, it would be interesting to talk about when he took on the chairmanships of committees, because he started off in a position of power, unlike when I was there. The Republicans were in the minority and he was in the minority of the minority of Republicans, given, as I said, his position. </p>
          <p>In the early 1980s with the Gang of Five, Lowell was in a position that he actually could ensure things were being done. As a result, there were some compromises he had to make that I think troubled him philosophically, but he was able then to achieve something more than he would have otherwise. So the ability to compromise is something that I think because he is bigger than life, because he takes such extreme positions initially, that I think folks miss sometimes what the end product is that he delivers because of his willingness to say, “Okay, that’s as far as I can go. I can become just a naysayer and we’ll lose, or I can get something, and I’ll take that something and I’ll oppose you, but I’m not going to filibuster this if you do it this way,” and that’s a tremendous art.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="005140"></a>0:51:40</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker gives staff members “privilege of the floor”</p>
<p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes it is. I want to go back just briefly to the issue of how he used staff members, because in his book and in the notes that have been prepared, it’s clear that he came to have so much confidence in you that he recommended that you be given the privilege of the floor in a number of debates that were going on on issues. Did you see that as a very unusual opportunity that you personally had, or do you think that he just did that with all staffers? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>There were others— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He talks about it in his book, specifically in relation to you, that he requested that you be given the “privilege of the floor” as debates were going on in terms of explaining certain positions in details, I guess.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>As I think I said to you, over the time period, the three-and-a-half years I worked with him, we obviously developed a wonderful relationship, and I think there were a number of issues, as I said. Having the position of just counsel enabled me to have the fun of being involved in the key issues, and I credit the other staff members who worked with me on these things, because we were set up by covering committees or substantive areas, there were other staffers who covered on a day-in-and-day-out basis certain issues or certain matters. If something became highly visible or was going to become highly visible, highly public, I would get the call from the Senator. “Hey, Stan, I want your help on this,” and lesser people could go, <em>Geez, here’s Twardy again</em>. He’s come in to be able to work on this issue. There was no one on the staff—because they were all were so dedicated to the Senator, we didn’t have any of that problem. </p>
          <p>I was the beneficiary of his confidence in me and it was special. I’ve told this story before, and it’s something I’ll never forget. It was in connection with the Chrysler bailout, which was in December of 1979, and that was really sort of when I started, into over that next year, plus when I started getting involved in the big issues. It was a Saturday night. I had my college roommate visiting from Colorado, in December, looking to go out, and I was covering a debate on the floor on some issue. I was working that night and sitting in the office building and Senator [Robert C.] Byrd called up the Chrysler bailout. </p>
          <p>Senator Byrd and Senator Weicker on the Wheeling-Pittsburgh bailout, which was another issue that had taken place earlier that year, and on one or two other issues, had had rancorous times on the floor of the Senate together. I believe at one point each of them called a point of personal privilege against the other, which was basically saying, “How dare you.” So things were very tense between them at the time. </p>
          <p>Interestingly, over the next eight years after I left, Senator Weicker and Senator Byrd worked together on a number of matters again when Lowell was taking that position at the core. I remember being on the floor of the Senate probably seven o’clock on a Saturday night and sitting in the well of the Senate in a chair that made me feel like a five-year-old next to the Senator’s chair and his desk, and that’s how the Senate floor is set up. There are small chairs next to every Senator’s chair so that staff can sit there, and Senator Byrd was talking so I called Senator Weicker in his hideaway. He came over and we met on the floor of the Senate and Senator Byrd went and said something on the floor of the Senate. </p>
          <p>Senator Weicker jumped up out of his chair and grabbed the microphone, ready and wanting to talk, you know, wanting to be recognized by the president pro tem of the Senate, and started walking up and down. I could see the smoke starting to rise. Senator Byrd was making some personal comments that were sort of pushing the envelope. And they were ones that you would have to know of the relationship between the two of them and some of the things that had gone on. I remember sitting there like a little kid reaching up and tugging the Senator’s jacket. He looked at me and I said, “Don’t let him get your goat,” and Lowell turned on his heels and walked the other direction, and I’m going, <em>Well, this has been fun. I’ll have a new job tomorrow.</em></p>
          <p>He walked down the aisle toward one end, came walking back, looked down at me, and said, “Don’t worry.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s great. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>And then he walked back. But it was, for me—I’d be interested to know. I’ve not had this conversation with him about it. For me it was sort of a turning point in our relationship. It was one that certainly empowered me to be more willing to—confront is not the right word—but more willing to debate the Senator on issues, and the same thing as Governor, as his chief of staff. We did probably more of it when he was Governor than when he was Senator, but it was one of those things, and again, talking to you earlier about my father and the discussions we had on Sunday, at dinnertime. My father was one that we would have open and earnest debates on, and it’s one of the things that I appreciate about Lowell. And to this day he and I will disagree on things but walk away, each of us I know having listened to each other and learned something in that discussion. So that was— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So he signaled to you in that moment that he was not going to hold it against you that you were giving him some personal advice?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Some good advice, yes. I was providing him good counsel.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He might not follow it, but at least it was okay that you did that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Correct. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="005826"></a>0:58:26</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s staff operations </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>All right, so you were going to tell me how the Governor’s staff worked differently on a day-to-day basis.<br>
          </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Yes, as a Governor there are two hats, and as we were talking earlier, Tom D’Amore in 1991 was the co-chief of staff with me. It was really the political side and the operations side, and I think that the first year that I was chief of staff, when I was co-chief of staff, somebody likened this to me, I was like the COO, the Chief Operating Officer. I was the one who would work with the commissioners on putting together the budgets, how things were being run, what issues were out there. I would have weekly meetings with the commissioners and deputy commissioners just to know what the issues were to try to keep everybody informed as to what was going on, and Governor Weicker would at the side of me sit in on those. </p>
          <p>The other side is dealing with the legislators, and Tom handled that not exclusively, but was very involved in that in 1991. Tom had the—really the point dealing with the income tax matter, but I had to deal with the legislators on other matters such as the Indian casino gaming. That was one that was my area, and so I worked with the legislators on that. I would work with legislators on a lot of other issues, but there as Governor, Lowell relied on his personal staff in dealing with legislators, dealing with union leaders, dealing with business leaders, and the like. </p>
          <p>The Office of Policy and Management he relied on for helping put the budget together, but Governor [William] O’Neill, who preceded Governor Weicker, relied extensively on OPM and the people at OPM to help set policy. Lowell was the one who was setting policy and using OPM to implement it. Now, having said that, Bill Cibes, the head of OPM, was intimately involved in the debates over budget and how you get places, but again, even there, I remember sitting down in November of 1990 after Weicker was elected Governor and starting to put together the budget. Lowell, remember, was on the Appropriations Committee. One thing I learned from him is “follow the money.” That is something that was wonderful advice for me as U.S. Attorney. It’s something I’ve used thereafter. Lowell would look at the money and know where the money was coming from, but he realized the money was also something that you could use for policy issues.</p>
          <p>One of the things that we did, for example, was in Connecticut when we were having problems in Bridgeport and we didn’t have any money. The inner city of Bridgeport was having problems. Lowell said, “Okay, well, you know what we can do? We’ll move the state police barracks from Westport, an affluent town, to downtown Bridgeport. We can’t give them any more money; we don’t have money, the City of Bridgeport, but if we have state police cars coming in and out of Bridgeport on 95, that’s going to send a message.”<br>
            So those are the types of things that Lowell was intimately involved in setting the policy.</p>
          <p>Again, going back to what we talked about earlier, the principles, the broad brushes, this is what I want, and then he would use for the budgetary things Bill Cibes and his folks. I think for other things it really devolved upon me to handle those aspects of running the government. He was a tremendous Senator, he was a tremendous Governor. His love is in policy and debating policy, and obviously as Governor you have to run a state also, and that’s where he relied upon, I think, very good people. He spent a lot of time finding commissioners, had very little turnover among the commissioners, and would rely upon them to make sure the trains ran on time, but he’d be the one who set the schedule for when then trains were to run.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="010207"></a>1:02:07</p>
          <p class="c-header">Guiding principles of Weicker’s career</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So what are the principles that you would most associate with him? We’ve talked about a few of them, but you know you’ve said he’s a man of principle. He’s very consistent over time. We talked about commitment to the Constitution, but what are the big general principles that you think have been guiding principles for him throughout his career?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>I think we have talked a little bit about them. The Constitution, okay? As he said, in Connecticut, our license plate says, “The Constitution State.” And, again, you have to remember here you’re talking about big, overarching principles that then will have subparts to them that will play out against the other principles. Helping those who can’t help themselves, and using, as I said earlier, the position of Senator or Governor to help those who cannot help themselves; making sure it’s a level playing field for people, but that’s consistent with the justice principles; that people are equal, should be treated equally, and that plays out if you look at the things he’s done. </p>
          <p>He was always very good on so-called race issues. He was good on affirmative action, diversity, something that he believes very much in because all people are created equal. Look at what he did with Nelson Mandela and how he was esteemed over in South Africa. But that was, again, consistent with Lowell, which is if it’s in the Constitution one place, but it’s also consistent with making sure it’s a level playing field for people, for businesses. Those are places where you’re looking to have the levelness there and also for those who cannot help themselves. Those are a couple—</p>
          <p>Also, principles, health, the whole health care, and it’s the concept, and he used the statistic all the time. I’ve forgotten exactly what it is now, but the percentage of health care costs that are spent on the last months of one’s life as opposed to what goes in up front. So much of what we do is at the end stages of a person’s life, whether it’s the nursing homes—should there be more money being put in in research to help up front? The concept of investment in the future. He’s from that old generation that we want to make this place a better place for those who follow us. He was against having his children pay for what was going on at the time. Again, it’s a true Republican principle, but it’s old Republicans, a Republican, really a financial approach to things. But those are some of them, and again, individual— </p>
          <p>To typecast, he was a Republican on economic issues and a Democrat on social issues.  But he was even more principled. There would be things that he would disagree with Democrats on. You couldn’t really typecast Lowell as I just did or tried to do there. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>But there were certain things you knew in advance where he was going to come down on things, because of what’s called the “third rail.” You would know what the third rail would be on something, and that would be something that was going just to spark Lowell one way or the other on an issue, and I think those couple of things that we’ve just talked about are probably the key bits.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So a fiscal conservative, but somebody who was deeply committed to social justice, and that’s not Republican or Democrat.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>That’s exactly right, and it’s social justice, and that’s a much better way of putting it than I could. Social justice across the board, across the continuum, yes, for those who have and those who don’t. One of the areas that he and I resonate because I love the law so much, as does he, is that when he was Governor, I was blessed to be able to spend a lot of time working with him on judges and the judiciary. I remember the words that he used when it was coming to, okay, should this person be a judge or not? It was, “Who do I want as a judge when I have my day in court? Who’s going to care?  Who’s going to take the time to care for me?” </p>
          <p>In a way, that’s Lowell, that he as Governor or Senator took the time to care for his constituents, all of them. Not just the ones who had access to him through the dollars and cents, but all of them, and there were times, you know, that he would take positions that were not favored by some of his financial supporters. It cost him some support over time, but also those who were truly the ones who helped him the most were ones who understood that they were going to get an honest read on an issue, and that’s really, again, what it comes down to. Lowell would give any issue, any person, anything, an honest read. </p>
          <p>Yes, he had certain principles. It’s not going to be on a blank slate, but if you could appeal to those philosophical principles and show him how he was wrong on something, he would listen. Again, a lot of people, I think, who see the bigger-than-life person that he was and would hear him make some of the statements he did, as you said earlier, he was not afraid to— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He was out there, wasn’t he?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Yes, he was out there. He was out there, and by the way, again, it was another one of those things that made him effective, because I don’t think those with whom he was doing battle, and that’s maybe overstating it, but those who were on the other side of him on issues, I think they saw him as a wildcard. I heard that when we were doing the income tax.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>A maverick, the original maverick.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Yes, yes, and he was proud of it. He didn’t walk away from it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He called his book that, didn’t he?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>He didn’t walk away from it, and you know, it was an interesting thing that came up with the whole issue in Connecticut on casino gambling. I say this as insight into him, but as a Senator, Weicker had been very influential in having the Mashantucket Pequots recognized as a tribe that led to their recognition by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, that led to them ultimately being in a position to having the casino, which has become so successful, but Lowell was—and blame me, because I was there right next to him having left as U.S. Attorney—concerned about the impact. I was concerned about corruption, crime, and the like. Lowell was concerned in addition to that on the quality of life within the state of Connecticut, not wanting Connecticut to end up like some of the places, Atlantic City, New Jersey, or the like.</p>
          <p>Our first meeting with Pequots after the legislature had rejected our attempts to get rid of the provision that basically was the courts had said that because Connecticut allowed the casino nights, the Las Vegas nights that were being used by nonprofits to raise money to come in and they’d have casino-type games, they were being licensed for nonprofit. That basically meant that under these compacts that existed, the Indians could do so for profit, and so what we tried to do was to beat back those Las Vegas nights. </p>
          <p>We won in the state senate but lost in the state house, and after we lost in the state house, Lowell met with the Mashantucket Pequots, and they walked in knowing him as a guy who’d been a big supporter and he turned to them and said, “You know what? I was on your side. I was a big supporter for you before, but you guys are being used here, and I want you to know I’m going to do everything I can to fight this.” </p>
          <p> He instructed me as a chief of staff, and this shows how he tacks—the first words were, “Stan, I don’t want this casino to open while I’m Governor. Do whatever you can to make sure it doesn’t open.” There were things that we could do, somewhat limited, but things we could do. What had happened at the time was, again, against the economic times, there were those in the legislature, especially Bill DiBella, who was I guess the majority leader of the Democrats in the senate, who were very supportive of having gambling in Hartford and Bridgeport. </p>
          <p>We actually met with Steve Wynn, the Governor and I, with Bill DiBella. We had lunch with Steve Wynn and made a big pitch as to what should happen, but ultimately Lowell realized that the tides were going that the state needed more money, that the cuts we were advertising for were unpopular, that people didn’t want to raise taxes, and Lowell having done the income tax in ’91 wasn’t about to raise taxes again. </p>
          <p>Things hadn’t turned around, and we knew that there was this out in the court ruling and the compact and the court ruling. Basically the way we wrote this all up was that the court ruling did not recognize—there was a certain class of gaming, that should the state allow this class of gaming then all bets are off, and Lowell, basically when we talked about this said, “Okay, Stan, since this is unclear in the ruling—” it gave us a vehicle to strike the compromise we did with the Indians, and basically whether or not video gaming was permitted in the state of Connecticut was unclear. That was what the court ruling left undone.</p>
          <p>And so basically it was the mission impossible meeting I had with him in which I said, “Lowell, I can get some people and we can talk to Charlie Duffy, who’s the lobbyist for the Mashantuckets, their lawyers who were very brilliant people, and I think, Lowell, we can probably work something out. We may be able to work something out whereby we can get revenues from the Indians if we allow this video gaming.” </p>
          <p>He said to me, “That’s okay, you can do it, but if it’s found out that you’re negotiating it, you’re doing it without my permission.” Because he had that position that he’d staked out that it’s not going to happen and he was fighting that, but we were then able to—and this is in essence legislative genius, the strategic, as I told you, the chess player, the chess master, thinking steps down the road. Now a quarter of the state’s revenues in Connecticut come from the casinos. We’re the only state in the country that gets revenues from the gaming operations at the two Indian casinos here in Connecticut. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you remember that period with the implementation of the income tax as being incredibly tense and difficult?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Oh, on lots of levels, yes it was. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He remembers it that way, for sure.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Well, it was, and I’ll go one step further. I had a year-and-a-half-old child and was living up in Hartford while my wife and daughter were home in Stamford, Connecticut, and it was probably from mid-April, early May, when it was clear that we weren’t going to get a budget done until August, just an amazingly tense time period. It was 24/7 working on trying to get something. </p>
          <p>The coalitions one, two, and three. I don’t know how much you got into it with him, but trying to put together different coalitions to get something passed. I was not with him, but probably the only time I saw Lowell scared was that he had done something up in New London and went without any staff, just the drivers. It was some theater or an opera or something and he was concerned that he was going to be physically attacked, that all he had was the state police. This was before he walked into the cast of thousands on the capitol steps, but this was one in which it was after that; either Tom or I were going to be with him at every event he went to and we were supposed to scope out every event. This was not only government, but the political events that he might be going to, who was going to be there. You know, he had death threats. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>I think that for him it was disappointing that the people of Connecticut reacted the way they did to this. I think he thought that folks in Connecticut would understand that if you look at the dollars and cents and things that were done, too, about how we were basically using the federal government to get some of the money, that by having the state tax, people can write that off on their federal income tax so it’s really coming from the federal government as opposed to the individuals. And things we were doing, repealing the capital gains tax or lowering the capital gains tax rates, things we did that folks just did not appreciate. Again, big picture items, and I think it was the venom of the opposition that surprised all of us. But in many ways it probably presaged the Tea Party stuff.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, well, sure, because people ultimately are voting what they think are their pocketbooks regardless of the larger implications for the societal good or maybe even their personal good.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>I was going to say, the knee jerk—the number of people living here in Fairfield, Connecticut, which is one of the wealthiest, I think even wealthier than Albemarle County and Charlottesville, that the number of people actually—a fair criticism of this could’ve been that we were helping out the people in Fairfield County, because the income tax that existed at the time was on capital gains and it was a huge capital gains tax, so that in addition to your federal capital gains, you were being taxed at an exorbitant amount by the state of Connecticut. That rate was lowered.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we had a situation where people who were living in Connecticut were paying taxes in New York. That got changed then, too. There were credits that would go back and forth, so there were things which we were able to do that in many ways in Fairfield County made it not as bad, but, boy, to this day I get grief from folks here in Fairfield County. “You were the ones who brought us the income tax.” [laughs]</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="011918"></a>1:19:18</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker considers running for President</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. I’m afraid we’re going to get close to the end of our time. But I have one specific question I wanted to ask. Clearly, you were part of the senatorial staff when the Senator considered jumping into the presidential fray, so I hope maybe you could talk about that period a little bit more and what you recall of it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Yes, I remember at the beginning I said the reason that I had gotten hired in the first place, I wrote about him running for President— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Just as an aside, he had asked me at one point if I would be willing to leave his Senate staff and work on his presidential campaign and I said, yes, of course I would. It was actually after he abandoned the presidential thoughts when I left the Small Business Committee to go become counsel. It was just in that time period, it was interesting, but I have to say that it was something that was being talked about at a different level than where I was with him at the time. I was still relatively new, not brand new, but within a year of being on the staff. There was never a time that I knew Lowell Weicker to do something for political gain. In other words, he did not at any time say, “Okay, I’m thinking about running for President. I want to take this position.”</p>
          <p>Now, I will say that I think that the Montrealer was one that we actually had hearings up in Vermont. I don’t think it hurt him if he was going to be running for President to be seen up in Vermont in a hearing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>So there were some things like that that happened. I’m not naïve, okay? But as far as him changing his approach to things? Not at all. The principles that were guiding him were going to guide him even though it wasn’t going to hold him in good stead with the main party. Speaking of which, in 1984 with what he did, and I was an alternate delegate to the Republican convention in 1984. When he attacked the Republican platform on issues such as choice and went down into Dallas and made a stink, in the heart—I’ll never forget the reaction to what he did there. I left and went from Dallas to visit a friend of mine from college who was in Colorado. We went to see <span class="work-title">Red October</span>.  I don’t know if you remember that movie, but it’s basically a movie about Cuba— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>—invading the United States and the reaction to that and to me, I thought I’d seen a little bit of that down in Dallas with some of the reaction. It was as though Lowell Weicker was the devil incarnate for coming in here and suggesting some of these civil liberties, social justice positions for the Republican Party.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I have three more questions, and they’re big questions, so I’ll just lay them out and I’ll let you take them in any order you want. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’d like you to comment on what you think his greatest strengths are and what weaknesses you think he actually had as a public servant or as a person that you worked with directly, and finally, what is his greatest legacy? What will and what should he most be remembered for? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>His greatest strength I think is his vision and his integrity, and as he said, he wasn’t afraid to lose. I don’t know how many people can say that. I think if I took that approach as a lawyer I wouldn’t be making much money, that’s for sure, but Lowell really believed that. Lowell didn’t care about losing. His principles were more important to him. His integrity was more important, and I think that his greatest strength was his integrity and especially his integrity vis-à-vis his principles, you know, overarching. That what you saw is what you got. </p>
          <p>As I said, the guy I had a drink with in the hideaway in the Senate with other Senators was the same guy who was out there on the floor of the Senate. He did not have that type of agenda, and one of the few people I’ve met in my life who doesn’t operate that way. And to this day, at age 79, there are things he believes in strongly, and there’s no equivocation on that. That may be the weakness, you know, a little bit on the equivocation. I think that sometimes on issues he would be driven by who might be on the other side. </p>
          <p>I’ll tell you an interesting story he told me about Jennings Randolph. Jennings Randolph was a Senator from West Virginia, and Lowell was a brand new Senator as he told me this story. There was a vote on funding for an airport some place in West Virginia, FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] support for an airport in West Virginia, and Lowell voted against it. </p>
          <p>He said a year later he had some piece of legislation he was trying to get through the floor of the Senate. It was on a consent calendar, meaning that no one was going to object on it and he could move it through relatively pro forma, something to help here in Connecticut. He got up on the floor of the Senate and was about to move for its passage and he says, “Jennings Randolph burst through the doors of the Senate floor and said, ‘Mr. President, Mr. President, I want to be recognized,’ and started talking and talking and talking,” and it became clear to Lowell that Randolph was going to oppose this legislation. And Lowell—I guess what they would do is if the Senators wanted to have a chance to talk they would suggest the absence of a quorum, which then—what would happen is the clerk of the Senate would start reading the names, and so you’d have to have a hundred names to see—it basically was to kill time.</p>
          <p>Again, this is how he tells the story, or as I recall it—he went to Jennings Randolph and said, “Jennings, what’s going on here?” And Jennings says, “Lowell, remember the FAA bill?” And Lowell said, “Jennings, this has nothing to do with the airport in West Virginia,” and Randolph said, “this has everything to do with the airport in West Virginia.” </p>
          <p>And that there were principles like that that Lowell would—someone would cross him on something and Lowell would never forgive him, and that’s not true because there are some people who voted against him on certain things on votes that Lowell would forgive, but I think that there are things that—and again, this is consistent with his principles. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>It’s very consistent with his principles, but sometimes that may have clouded how he approached dealing with people thereafter, and that may have affected getting them on board. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The success. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>So that really is, as I look at it—the other story I have to tell is really where I’d put him on things, which—well, it’s some very personal things that he’s done for my family and for me and for lots of folks, that his strengths are his commitment, his passion, and you ask what should he be remembered for? It’s his commitment; it’s his passion for people, for those social justice issues that we’ve been talking about here. It is his passion for that. To age 79 he is still passionate about it, but about doing it the right way. </p>
          <p>Again, coming back to these are principles, this is what I believe in. I’m willing to put my seat in the Senate or my chair as Governor on the line, but these are the things I stand for and will live or die by those things. He is bigger than life in that way, his commitment, his passion, his belief, his looking out for the underdog in many ways. A guy who comes from a wealthy family, wealthy upbringing, had everything, he’s the first to say a private school, Yale College, Virginia Law School, Squibb fortune, yet he was one who was more in tune to the have-nots. </p>
          <p>What he did in AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome], all the work he did on AIDS when he was chair of the HHS Subcommittee, I remember him coming back from the leper colonies in Hawaii and just talking about that, how that moved him. The story I told earlier about the poor young child. This is what power, wealth, should be doing, should be helping those who don’t have it, to make the world a better place, and that’s Lowell. Make this country a better place. </p>
          <p>His belief in ideas working. One of the things he’d talk about, as you know, and I think this cost him the election in ’88 because of the money that Lieberman got from the Cubans in Miami—but when Lowell went down to meet with Fidel Castro his whole pitch was the United States was making a mistake in its dealings with Cuba by not opening the door to an exchange of ideas because in the world, the American ideals, the Constitution that we set up going back to that, the system of government and the ideals that have flowed from that Constitution will win in the court of public opinion. </p>
          <p>If you look at it, what’s happened with the fall of the Iron Curtain in many ways reflects, yes, it’s more than just the Constitution, but you think where did it all come from, the font of it, with the American system, whether it’s the Coke, clothing, and the like that had so much impact, but it’s still those ideals. It’s our ideals that the United States took as it evolved from the political philosophers. It’s that free flow of ideas, and his feeling was Cuba would’ve pushed Castro out years ago if we had let them, opened our doors to them and vice versa, and so that passion, that belief of this country, the principles of our Founding Fathers, that’s his legacy. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And he himself has said in my talks with him that coming from a place of privilege gave him the opportunity to stick to his principles without fearing the consequences. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He is a person of privilege. He had the means, so if he lost, he lost. He didn’t feel—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>He didn’t need the job.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Exactly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>You’re right, that position of privilege helped him in his political life, but he also—I saw this—you were talking before the income tax time period, that during that time period, as I mentioned, because we were 24/7, I basically would spend Saturday and Sunday night at home with my family and be up, actually would spend Friday and Saturday night at home, go up Sunday night to Hartford, lived in the residence. I had my own room and Lowell joked that we had a Christmas ornament of the governor’s residence. “Here’s your room, Twardy.” [laughter] I was living there so much, but I had the good fortune of dining on a regular basis not only with Lowell and Claudia [Weicker], but with their children when they were there and the discussions that they would have at the dinner table. What was clear in those discussions is that with privilege comes an obligation.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He has essentially said that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>And that’s it, that making the world, the country, a better place, helping those who can’t help themselves to a better place. That’s what Lowell Weicker is all about.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And there’s no specific issue that you think more than any of the others. I mean, some people would say it was really what he did with Watergate. Some people would say it was the environmental issues. He personally feels very strongly about what he fought for in terms of the oceans and the environment.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>The oceans and the environment, right. I think others would say that the disabled— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. But is there anything you in particular want to focus on other than the core principles? Obviously that’s a fine thing to focus on, but I’m just wondering if there— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Listen, for me as a person, I think Lowell will be remembered for the Watergate and his role in the Watergate. I mean, when I look back now and listen, the conversations I had with him, I remember going up into his archives where he had documents up in the Senate, the Capitol, and looking at stuff that he had from the Watergate and when I was a staffer for him. It was just mind numbing for me. I think that the public being what it is, he will be remembered for the Watergate because it was such a seminal event in our country’s history. </p>
          <p>I think those who know his true role in the Americans with Disabilities Act, that he was the one who authored it but he was defeated before it was finally enacted, but with its 20th anniversary happening, he’s now being recognized for it. Those who really know will see him for that. With what he did with the oceans, he’ll be remembered for that. I think what he did with NIH [National Institutes of Health]. </p>
          <p>The reason I come back to it is that he did so much. I think it does a disservice to say this is the place he’ll be remembered. The general public may remember him for that. There are going to be people who are going to remember him for the income tax. There are going to be people who are going to remember him for casino gaming, the Indian gaming, but I think that those who know him, really know him, know how broad his impact was, how diverse his impact was, that to single out one would be to do a disservice to him because he’s had such broad-brush impact on folks.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think this is a fine place to end the conversation today. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">S. Twardy: </span>Thank you, Phyllis. It was a pleasure. </p>
