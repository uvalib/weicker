          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is Phyllis Leffler. The date is April 22. I’m at the home of Governor Lowell P. Weicker for the second of our interviews in the series related to the Lowell Weicker Papers. Good morning, Governor.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Good morning, Phyllis.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Last time we spent quite a bit of time talking about your campaigns and the trajectory of your political career. A couple of things we didn’t get to that I’d love to hear about—your reflections relating to your own party affiliations. I know that your career is legendary in some ways for your willingness to take on your own party, for your willingness to distinguish yourself from some of the values of the Republican Party and to move in a direction that eventually caused you to split from the Republican Party when you ran for Governor, so I wonder if you could just reflect on that, on why you felt it necessary to do that. I know some of that related specifically to positions on issues, but clearly that was a significant political risk you took as well.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000127"></a>0:01:27</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s early Republican background</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>First of all, I think that I have to examine my own background as to why I was a Republican in the first place, and then move from there through the various experiences. I was born and raised in very privileged areas—Park Avenue and the Buckley School in New York, Yale, the north shore of Oyster Bay, the north shore of Long Island. The circles in which I grew up were clearly Republican circles. </p>
          <p>Counterbalancing that to some extent was my mother, who only attained American citizenship, I think, in the last few years of her life. She basically was British and held onto her British citizenship, and as such, was deeply grateful to Franklin Roosevelt for having brought the United States into the conflict on the side of Great Britain. So she was clearly a fan of FDR’s, and I have to say I was, too, to a certain extent, even as a very young man. </p>
          <p>I remember at the Buckley School they had a large debate between two students, one taking the part of Thomas Dewey, one taking the part of Franklin Roosevelt, and I took the part of Franklin Roosevelt, mirroring the presidential campaign of Dewey and Roosevelt. It was really interesting. It shows you how nothing really changes in the world. When the debate was over, everybody had a chance to vote for who they wanted, and needless to say, all my Park Avenue co-dwellers, students, they all voted for Thomas Dewey, and all the faculty voted for me, so I think that some things really don’t change. [laughter]</p>
          <p>But the reason I mention it is that this was really the milieu in which I was placed, so over the course of time, obviously, in a general way, I listened to much more of the Republican Party and what it stood for than I did Democrats. When I went to Yale I had the chance to join one of four parties in the political union. They were the Conservative Party, the Bull Moose Party, the Liberal Party, and the Labor Party, and I chose the Bull Moose Party, which in effect were progressive Republicans. </p>
          <p>I remember, as a matter of fact, and I never will forget, that when I first moved to Charlottesville and I was about ready to register to vote, one of my neighbors who came from a long line of southerners explained to me that if I wanted to make sure my vote counted I should register with the Democrats. [laughter] Well, I didn’t think that was a particularly good idea, and I registered down here as a Republican and felt very strongly from day one that on social issues I certainly had a very progressive bent, yet I was very much of a fiscal conservative. Always was.</p>
          <p>The next impact on my philosophy or my Republicanism was when I ran for office in Connecticut, I was mainly backed in the Republican primary that I alluded to earlier by conservative Republicans in Greenwich, Connecticut. The significance of that was that when it came time to run for the Congress, those same conservative Republicans backed my effort and they also wanted me to back the candidacy of Barry Goldwater, which I did. Like many other people, I started to get a few doubts during the course of his campaign as to some of the rhetoric that he engaged in. </p>
          <p>That said, I also want to point out at this juncture, since I’m sure it probably will come up in the interview, that as our lives more closely intertwined, I became a huge admirer of Barry Goldwater. I thought that the man was a true conservative in the best sense of the word, i.e., he split from the party as I did on constitutional issues. He didn’t want prayer in school and he didn’t want court stripping or any of that stuff. Fiscally, yes, he was a conservative, very much defense oriented, all of that, but I liked the man, and I might add he lived in Phoenix and his wife was a very good friend of my sister’s, and I had a chance just a little bit before he died to sit down and have a long talk with Barry Goldwater, and he said, “My God, Lowell, I would be considered a liberal in today’s Republican Party.” So anybody with any brains could see the handwriting on the wall as to what was going on in the party. Not just me, but a stand-up guy like Barry Goldwater.</p>
          <p>In any event, I was asked to support his nomination for President by delivering the delegates from Fairfield County, and indeed, in the Connecticut delegation we had a split. I forgot how many there were in the delegation, but let’s assume the fact it was 15 people. Well, ten were progressive Republicans and five were Goldwater and the conservatives. And again, here is a story within a story. </p>
          <p>The chairman of the Republican Party in Connecticut was a man by the name of Searle Pinney, and Searle knew that the state was Democratic, was progressive, and didn’t want to have anything to do with Goldwater as did, indeed, most of the northeastern states, and it was only by the pressure that I brought with the people from Greenwich who basically funded the Republican Party in the state of Connecticut. The Republican Party in the state of Connecticut was funded by the cadre of givers from Greenwich, Darien, New Canaan, and the Gold Coast, so we got our way and we got those delegates. </p>
          <p>Well, there was no question about the fact that Pinney was right. I mean the Goldwater candidacy was just a disaster in Connecticut when it came to the general election, and it was something that I learned later on as I became titular head of the party and tried to move the party toward a progressive stance. As a matter of fact, this is the first time I thought about this in my conversation with you, why it was that I drew such offense to the chairmanship of Frederick Biebel, who was the chairman around the time that I was Senator. It was the fact that he wanted to link up with Ronald Reagan’s people in Washington and I wanted the party to stay on an entirely different course, being that Connecticut was not Washington. It certainly wasn’t Reagan’s United States of America. It was a solid Democratic state that was difficult to win in, and you weren’t going to win it by ultra-conservative philosophies.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001015"></a>0:10:15</p>
          <p class="c-header">As Congressman, Weicker takes a more progressive stance</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>After that experience and I became the congressman, it was definitely imprinted in my mind that a progressive stance was in order. In other words, for the state that I wanted to represent, or the 4th Congressional District, as much as it included Darien and New Canaan and Greenwich it also included Bridgeport, and Bridgeport was by far and away the largest city in the district. </p>
          <p>Bridgeport had all the problems back then in the ’60s and early ’70s that it does today, even more so. It’s typical of the old rust belt cities in the state of Connecticut, all of which are old manufacturing towns—Waterbury, Bridgeport—New Haven to a lesser extent in that it had Yale University. But the big cities had been abandoned, and that immediately enmeshed you into the status of the poor, of minorities, of all the issues you never saw in Greenwich, Connecticut, and if you wanted to go ahead and represent these people, never mind get elected, you had to go ahead and pay attention to their problems. Nobody in Greenwich ever asked me for anything. Nobody in Greenwich needed anything, so you never heard from Greenwich, Connecticut.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But there must have been something. You describe your background as a privileged background and the people that you interacted with as people coming from positions of privilege. There must’ve been something in you, deeply personal to you, that triggered this larger sense of social—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, I think that—but the experience did. No matter how I felt, when you come face to face with the realities, plural, of a Bridgeport, if you don’t change, you’re either an idiot or you’re a very callused individual. It was those experiences that made me realize that there was a world out there that needed to partake of my power as a congressman or as a Senator, whereas nobody from Greenwich did. There were plenty of people who had lower incomes in Greenwich, but basically I think I speak of it as a very privileged area. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Through the ’70s and ’80s when you were both a congressman and a Senator, do you remember specific moments when there was a lot of pressure from colleagues about your positions?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, but there would be on a variety of levels. Certainly there was always with the Republican administration the matter of defense, however that presented itself, whether it was missile systems or whatever-have-you, and those attitudes, don’t forget, never changed for me right up until when I opposed Joe Lieberman on the war in Iraq. Quite frankly, I don’t like our presence in Afghanistan today. I see the role of the United States internationally as being able to win over a world not through arms but through the tremendous economic power we have and the use of that power for good in different ways. </p>
          <p>Don’t forget that my interest, for example, in health and health care stems from the fact that my family founded one of the great pharmaceutical companies of the world, Squibb.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I was always used to hearing as to what we were doing to alleviate pain and suffering, so I butted heads with administration and Republicans on issues of defense.</p>
          <p>The rest of it becomes a little cloudy at the outset when you have to realize—I know nobody understands this—but there used to be a Republican Party that was very active in social ways. Jerry Ford, Richard Nixon, these men, in their social commitments, were progressives in the Republican Party. They were fiscal conservatives, both of them, but progressive, and slowly but surely, especially with Ronald Reagan, you did a total flip-flop where all of a sudden the fiscal conservatism went out the window. We never had such unbalanced budgets as were created by Reagan, and the social concerns just went out the window. So now you’re left with an addiction to the military and to God, and that becomes the Republican Party. </p>
          <p>I would say progressively during those years, in other words, in the House and Senate, as I came across issue after issue we butted heads more often than not. I also take great pride in the ’70s of being a voice for civil rights. The Democrats sort of gave up on that after they had led the fight for a long time, and it really was left up to [Charles] “Mac” Matthias, the Senator from Maryland, and myself to go ahead and wage a battle on issues of civil rights. </p>
          <p>I saw a very interesting—while we’re here talking on the 22nd of April, I think it would be the 20th of April 2010 I saw a big section of the—what’s the guy’s name with MSNBC <span class="work-title">Chris Matthews Show</span>—and a big section on how there was a purge of Republicans now with Arlen Specter and Bob Bennett, if you can believe it, and Charlie Crist and some—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh yes, Charlie Crist particularly they’re talking about.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, they were talking about Bob Bennett and they’re talking about a group of these, as these conservatives are being purged by even more conservative types, and all I could think of was, my God, this purge has been going on in the party for a long time, because you were talking Clifford Case, you’re talking Jack Javits, Lowell Weicker, Ed Brooke. I go right down a long list, and in more recent days, John Chafee’s son [Lincoln] Chafee up in Rhode Island. The Republican Party has steadily over the past two decades purged its progressive members. And so it’s now exactly become what I always said with I think probably more foresight than I realized at the time, the party of God and rural America and defense and that’s it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s still resonating, though, with the general public. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I know. But it isn’t involved, nor has it been involved, with any human needs for a long, long time, and that becomes even more distinct in these times. We’ll go back and I’ll let you ask questions, because I’m maybe rambling too much, but it became clear to me that when I lost the election in 1988 to Joe Lieberman, aside from the fact that as I’ve already stated, I was lazy, and aside from the fact that clearly I’d taken controversial stands too many times for too long a period of time, the fact is that it was the Republicans that defeated me. </p>
          <p>That showed up clearly in the vote results where the Republican support normally coming out of the Gold Coast, Fairfield County, just wasn’t there, so when I had to make up my mind as to what I was going to do, if I ran again for public office, there was no question in my mind I was not getting into a foxhole with Republicans. It’s tough enough when you have to shoot the guy in front of you, never mind worrying whether you’re going to get shot in the back, and that was the breakpoint in terms of my official association with the Republican Party.</p>
          <p>I always thought, even when I was being most heavily criticized by Republicans, that they would be proud of me for presenting another side of the Republican Party, we weren’t all ultra-conservatives, we had progressives that could offer something to the perception of the American people, but apparently that wasn’t so, and certainly it isn’t so today. I suppose you can mask that by saying they’ve won a lot of elections. They’ve won a lot of elections, quite frankly, because of the ineptness of the Democratic Party as much as what it is that they stood for.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So how would you respond to those who have argued that you became willing to abandon the small-government ideology of the Republican Party? Do you think that’s true?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, I think it’s true, and I suppose my answer there is what would you say to people who say you have abandoned the United States for the world? And I would say, well, that’s just the way the world has gone, isn’t it? We now live in a global scenario. Anything you do financially or whatever has a global impact. Well, I would say the same for my own country. The days of being able to just go ahead and keep problems at a small level and having them handled at a small level, they don’t exist. It is true that if somebody sneezes in California, you get a cold in Virginia. Everything that goes on within the United States impacts this country, and even more so in a day of instant communication. So, yes, I don’t think small government can handle the problems of the United States today any more than the United States can just handle its problems and be oblivious of the world around it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And before we move on, when you broke with the party in 1990 you said, “I was a damned good Republican. It was the party that changed, not me.” I think you have already addressed that, but do you still believe that to be true?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, I believe that to be true, and if I’m not mistaken, those are almost the exact words of Arlen Specter when he left the party also. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think they would be the words of any Republican now. Look, I have to remind the American people, because this is also what bothers me when I listen to the news. When they talk about the Republican Party, I hear no mention of what the party used to be, and it used to be Nelson Rockefeller and Jack Javits and Clifford Case and Bob Stafford and Mac Matthias and Mark Hatfield, John Sherman Cooper—I go down a huge list of members of the United States Senate who are all progressive Republicans, and it’s true that we also had a very large conservative contingent. </p>
          <p>Norris Cotton from New Hampshire, Barry Goldwater from Arizona, a lot of conservatives in there, so it was a very broad tent that was the Republican Party of the 1960s, ’70s. Hugh Scott, who was the minority leader. Even Howard Baker, for God’s sakes, who was a majority leader in the Senate. These were all progressives to a greater or lesser degree, but there was none of what you’re seeing today, and certainly not the litmus tests of abortion and defense and marriage and this nonsense that you have to stand up there and put your hand on a—“No new taxes” pledge. My God, the whole country is crumbling around us because of that stupid mantra today and we’re going to have to pay a fearful price to put it back together, and yet people say, “Oh, we don’t want any new taxes.” </p>
          <p>We’re willing to wage a war for eight years in Iraq and pay for it, but we’re not willing to pay for the repairs to our schools and hospitals and roads and bridges here in the United States. This is insane. Anyway, to get back to the question that you asked—the Republican Party that I was raised in as a congressman and as a Senator up until the start of what I call the Jesse Helms/Newt Gingrich era, was a party that was totally different from the one that exists today.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It really starts in the 1990s, right, with Newt Gingrich? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, Helms came in with Reagan. You’re talking sort of the mid ’80s. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. But Newt Gingrich I think was making his mark in the early ’80s.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, and the incivility started with Gingrich. I would never accuse Helms of that. Helms was a very civil individual. He was very far right, but he certainly was a gentleman. There was no problem with that. And starting then is when we started this drift to where we are today. I remember the Republican era was extended by the ineptness of the Democrats, more particularly John Kerry’s campaign. </p>
          <p>I remember being in New York the night of the election and waking up the next morning to see that Bush is going to get a second term, and Claudia said, “Boy, you’re really down in the dumps.” I said, “I am. And I’ll tell you why I’m down in the dumps. By his re-election, you’ve put the stamp of approval of the American people on his first four years. My God, that ought to frighten anybody, because we’re going to be in for more of the same times two.” And of course that’s what happened. As I say, much of that was due to the total ineptness of the Democratic campaign against him. So I think the Republicans in some ways were very lucky in terms of having a longer term on the job than they had deserved.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m sure in the ensuing hours we’ll spend together we’ll come back to some of these things, but I think maybe if you’re okay with this, we should perhaps move on and start talking about some of the specific issues that you were involved in. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. As we leave this, I was rummaging through my papers. I don’t know whether this is in the archives, but I’m going to give it to you now, and hopefully in your travels, it’ll take you exactly one hour if that, not even that, a half hour to read it, this was an address that I gave at Dickinson College on their Constitution Day, and it sums up—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>When was that done?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>This was done September 18, 1997. I read it and I have to tell you, it sounds very conceited, but my God, talk about hitting the nail on the head as to everything that’s going on right now, it did the job. And you can have that. [Weicker gives copy of his address to Leffler]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Great. Thank you. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It’s a very concise exposition of my ideas on many of the things that you and I have been talking about.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s terrific. Thank you. And just for the record, I’ll say it’s called, “The Constitution: Any Present Value?” and it’s related to this talk that you gave. Thank you. I will look forward to reading this. </p>

          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’d like to move on to something that happened and that you were involved in right at the beginning of your career, particularly in the Senate, and that would be the Watergate issues. The Watergate break-in occurred on June 17, 1972, and by February of 1973, the Select Committee to Investigate Watergate was created and you were named to that in February of ’73. By March of ’73, one month later, you begin to develop your own investigation in which you said you were going to explore these issues on your own because on some levels you’re dissatisfied with the way that the Committee exploration seems to be going. How were you able to determine so quickly that you were dissatisfied with the investigation?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>But I don’t think that’s right. I don’t know where it appears that I said I was dissatisfied with what—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, you may not have said that, but clearly the record shows that you wanted to conduct your own investigation.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, again, I think that’s been overblown. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I did want to do—look, let’s start from the beginning. Hugh Scott put me on that Committee because I represented the new generation in the United States Senate, a young freshman, not beholden to administrations or special interests, but sort of a fresh face on it. I asked Hugh Scott whether I could be on the Committee. I was close to Hugh. Hugh campaigned for me when I was running for the Senate, and I liked the man very much. I said to him, “If there’s an opportunity to serve, I’d like to,” because don’t forget, one of my issues had been, even before the Watergate occurred, campaign reform, how we could clean up campaign process. I’d just started to get into that, but it was an interest of mine. </p>
          <p>So I think Hugh responded by appointing a super-partisan in terms of Ed Gurney of Florida, and I had a moderate but savvy veteran in Howard Baker to be the Republican minority leader on this Committee, so these were two older hands in the Senate. They figure we’ll have a younger man come in there, Lowell Weicker.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003232"></a>0:32:32</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker adds his own personnel to the Committee staff</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker:</span> Well, as such, I clearly didn’t have much command over appointing staff members to the Committee. I knew that the job was big and I wanted to really do a good job at it, and so I made sure that I involved some of my office staff in the affairs of the Committee. That would give me just as much strength, in other words, in what became a torrent of information to go ahead and sift through that information and try to make sense out of it. I think there’s been too much emphasis—and you’re not the first person that’s done this, this happened all along. Well, he developed his own investigation.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, it was called “the third front.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, well, whatever it was called, all I know is I wanted to work with the Committee, but I didn’t have the resources within the Committee to do the job I felt needed to be done, and therefore I added my own personnel to the Committee staff. I think it’s a good thing I did because clearly, on the minority side—first of all, the majority wasn’t going to go ahead and do the work for the Republicans, and as much as I can appreciate Sam Dash, and I think he’s perfectly adequate counsel, but certainly that wasn’t his job, and they had some pretty damn good guys that were their investigators on the majority—Terry Lenzner, Scott Armstrong. Gosh, there was one other guy that was really tremendous. These were good men and they were sharp, and they were going to do their job, and the majority was going to look pretty damn good doing its job. </p>
          <p>The minority, on the other hand, what were we left with? Fred Thompson, who literally at the outset became an errand boy for the White House. Every time we’d have a meeting he’d go shuffling off to talk to Nixon’s people and then come back and give the orders as to what Baker should go ahead and do, etc. I mean it was a nothing.</p>
          <p>So what I did was just to make sure that there was going to be somebody that—and Gurney certainly was going to—Gurney’s people were going to do nothing on it. They were just going to say no.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No to?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Anything. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>i.e., he didn’t even want the damn Committee, and he was 100 percent for Richard Nixon, and so nothing was going to happen there. So where does that leave me?  It leaves me to the point where I either go along with Fred Thompson and his cronies, or I at least have my own people there that can make some sense on the Committee, so I think that’s the reason. I’ve always chafed a little bit at this idea of a separate investigation as if I made up my mind to go ahead and do that. That’s just not the case.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>When I talked with Bill Shure, he, too, said he didn’t see it that way.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Good. Well, I’m glad.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But much of the literature refers to it that way.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I know. I know.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think in your book you also talk, if I’m not mistaken, about your sense of the need to explore this more on your own because you didn’t really have confidence in the Committee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s true.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003615"></a>0:36:15</p>
          <p class="c-header">Importance of Republicans taking a lead in Watergate hearings</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. But in exploring this on your own, just think about this. Maybe you can’t think about it, but you’re a freshman Senator drawn into what nobody knew was really going to end up being quite such a conflagration in the American political history. You’re taking the steps to go down this path and you take some pretty courageous and gutsy steps in terms of who you’re willing to go out and speak to and who you are bringing to the table, and you’re doing that just because you saw that as your responsibility?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, okay. Now you’ve raised the valid point as to why I did it. I knew that this was going to be a major disaster for the Republican Party if indeed we allowed the Democrats to do the work. And you’ve come to the conclusion, supported by fact, that I wanted the Republicans to be out there. In other words, as much in the lead on this as the Democrats, and this is where I’m going to bring an instance, which I know you probably already read, to reaffirm what I’m saying. </p>
          <p>I later hired him on my staff—Jack Gleason. When Jack Gleason, who ran the townhouse operation which was giving cash contributions to Republican senatorial candidates, called me up and said, “Lowell, I’m going to turn over documentation of the contributions given to each United States Senator in an envelope addressed to that Senator and I’m going to turn it all over to George [H.W.] Bush at the Republican National Committee.” I said, “Jack, that’s fine as far as I’m concerned. Go ahead and do your thing.” </p>
          <p>Gleason and I had already talked on what my situation was. The White House had already leaked the fact that they’d given a cash contribution to my campaign. The reason why they missed the target on me was, and it was probably fate more than anything else, at the time they wanted to give me the cash contribution, I was just campaigning somewhere upstate and I instructed that they should give it to my treasurer, Phil Drake, so I never received it in hand personally, and then we went ahead and declared the contribution in Connecticut, because Connecticut law required anything like that to be declared. The federal law didn’t. Anyway, that’s why when Archibald Cox and the special prosecutor who I asked to investigate me came forth clearing me of all problems.</p>
          <p>When Gleason called me—and I’d gotten to know Jack, because he had warned me that they were going—well, John Dean had warned me first and then Gleason warned me second, that Nixon’s people were going to do this. In any event, he called me and says he’s going to put these envelopes in the hands of the RNC [Republican National Committee], and that’s when Bush calls me and says, “Lowell, I’ve just been given these envelopes with all these various contributions in there. What should I do? Should I go ahead and burn them?” I remember so distinctly that I then turned to him, and this comes back to your question. I said, “George, the Republican National Committee is not involved in this scandal. The Committee to Re-elect the President [CREEP] is, and don’t you bring the Republican National Committee into this scandal by doing that.” </p>
          <p>That answers your question in the sense of why did I want to be out front on this thing, because I felt I was protecting the Republican Party. I was under no obligation to protect Richard Nixon, and indeed, his campaign style from the days he ran in California didn’t deserve protection. It deserved condemnation from his first race against Helen Gahagan Douglas and all of his business with the communists and all the rest of it. I didn’t give a shit about Richard Nixon and the way he campaigned. I cared deeply about my own party, feeling that if it was the party itself that unearthed the wrongdoing of the Republican President we would save the party, and I felt the same way, as I say, in my comments. The proof of that was my comments to George Bush.</p>

          <p class="c-header">Weicker seeks out John Dean</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why do you think you were so able to get people to talk to you, people like John Dean, for example? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, but each one has to be on its own. Let’s talk about John Dean. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know you got to know him.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Very well.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>On a more personal than a political—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, sure. I could get on the phone and get ahold of him right now. We could start talking. As you know, John lived across the street from me in Old Town Alexandria. Early on, when nobody could find John Dean in Washington and it was rumored that he was going to go ahead and tell the truth on what had occurred at the White House, I sent out the word that I wanted to sit down and talk to him. I got somebody to get the word to his attorney—I think Charlie Shaffer was his attorney—in any event, saying that I wanted to get his side of the story. </p>
          <p>I met John Dean—apparently, I’d met him. He made an office visit or two, but this was before Watergate, when he was acting in his capacity as counsel for the President, but I’m talking about when I met him, when I knew I met him. I mean, I’d meet a thousand people from the White House during the course of a year, but I’m talking about in the sense of Watergate. So I left word that I wanted to see him. </p>
          <p>I remember very distinctly that I was attending a performance of the opera, which I love, at the Kennedy Center, and a member of my staff came and got me and said that Dean would talk to me at this attorney’s home in Maryland late that evening. So I drove out to Charlie Shaffer’s house and I met John on a personal basis really for the first time. It was at that meeting that he said, “Aren’t you concerned about the White House coming down on your head?” and I said, “No, I don’t think I have anything to be concerned about.” He said, “Are you sure you don’t have something to be concerned about financially?” He was referring to that townhouse operation. I said, “Well, not that I know of. I’ll put it that way.” </p>
          <p>In any event, we had our first conversation there in Charlie Shaffer’s house as he just sort of broadly outlined the matters that were going on at the White House. And that was in advance of the Committee hearings. In the months ensuing, I’d see him all the time or I’d just walk across the street to his house. We’d sit and chat. We’ll get back to that later, but, for example, that’s where the enemies list was discovered. We were getting toward the end of the hearings and I said, “John, is there anything that you haven’t said before the Committee, anything you can remember?” He said, “I don’t think so. I think I’ve said everything.” He said, “I might have one thing here that you may be interested in.” That’s when he showed me the documentation of Nixon’s enemies list.</p>
          <p>In any event, we got to be very close friends. He also knew Pete Kinsey. Kinsey was my administrative assistant. Pete came out of the White House and he had been the adviser on tax matters. He and John Dean were good friends, so the association with Kinsey, my own contacts with him, led us to have a very close relationship. There was another name you mentioned. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I mentioned John Dean. Well, of course, there was also Patrick Gray.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I’ll get to that, but I thought you mentioned another name that I was going to—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I didn’t just yet, no. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Because I said you have to take each one one-by-one. I can do Patrick Gray. There was no other name that you mentioned to me?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, I actually didn’t at this point. But the general principle that I really want to get at is that you did seem to have a capacity through meeting with people—I know you met with the actual people who did the break-in in jail. You just went around and talked to these people and you were able to get all kinds of significant interviews. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, it started off with a very minor character that you’ll never hear about, a fellow by the name of Ed DeBolt. Ed DeBolt was on the Republican National Committee. He came from California, and I just sat down with Ed DeBolt one day—this was before I met anybody—and said, “Tell me about Richard Nixon. Tell me about his campaign.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s in your book, I think. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And it started the business of trying to get into the mindset of the President and his people.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why do you think people were so willing to talk to you?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Because they were getting dumped on by the President of the United States. They had nobody to stand up. This was at a time when the country as a whole believes that a President can do no wrong. You don’t go ahead and question a President. It was only a short while before that before you would even question a United States Senator. My God, to be a Senator put you at a level where people didn’t ask you questions. They didn’t have debates, you know. They didn’t have people question them in the supermarket. A Senator was just way up there and you don’t do that. Certainly you didn’t do it with the President. We were living at a time when everybody thought, Well, this is just impossible. The President’s the President and no serious wrong can attach to him. </p>
          <p>The net result is that the President can go ahead and squash the little guy below him in whatever style he deems fit. Just take a look at the Cubans. My God, they were screwed and they had everything working against them. The highest office in the land. [laughter]  And when I met with them in Danbury Prison, those great words of—which one of the burglars—I can’t think. It’s getting toward the end of the day. The light is very poor. We’re sitting in this prison and he says, “Senator, I’ve worked for your government for the last—” whatever years it was. I’ve written it down in the book. “And look where I am today.” So you draw a certain sympathetic bond with people who were getting nailed like that. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Patrick Gray’s role in Watergate</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>The Pat Gray story is an entirely different one, but the Cubans, that was important. They were the ones, again, that communicated to me that they wanted me to come and talk to them. I did not volunteer to go talk to them. They wanted to talk to me after they’d been put in the slammer. Pat Gray I got to know—I’m trying to think if I got to know Pat in Stonington. I don’t think at that time—no, I hadn’t moved to Stonington. I was still in Greenwich. I got to know Pat, I think, when first he was nominated as the acting director of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], and like any other presidential nominee to a high position, obviously he had to come check in with his Senator. I think that’s where I first got to know Pat. And then— </p>
          <p>Oh, man, this is where I wish I had Bill Shure here. Was it something that Dean had told me relative to Pat? I know I went to see Pat in his office late at night and I told him a story was going to come out on his having burned papers at his home in Stonington and that it would be far better if he came out with it rather than get blindsided by the press. I’d have to review the sequence of events with Pat, but in any event, he heeded my advice to him and I feel to this day that because he did he basically avoided the penalties that could’ve been thrown on him. </p>
          <p>He was one of the most decent men I’ve ever met, obviously a courageous man. He’d commanded a submarine during World War II in the Pacific. He’d served his country just admirably, and in every way deserved to be honored by his country, and instead, he was used by Richard Nixon to go ahead and do things that normally he wouldn’t have done had he not wanted to be the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
          <p>Incidentally, young Gray is supposed to be writing a book on his dad, because I talked to him about a year or so ago. I don’t know if he has. But this is all detailed in that book.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Actually, I have right here in front of me the sequence, so let’s just see if this helps a little bit. So, the sequencing with Patrick Gray is that on March 6 he issues a statement as acting director of the FBI about his truthfulness in the Watergate investigation and gives you that statement personally. Okay, so that’s an earlier action. Then on March 16 you call the acting director, Fred Gray, to request access to the FBI’s Watergate files and he approves this, but [Sam] Ervin and Baker as well as Thompson and Dash refuse to authorize his decision. You’re denied access to the FBI files. Those activities with Gray happen in early March, and then it’s April 25, so it’s like six weeks later that you meet with Pat Gray, and at that point he tells you about [John] Ehrlichman and Dean asking him to hide the [E. Howard] Hunt papers. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Then the next day, you talk to the press about Gray’s role in the cover-up and then a story comes out on April 27 and he resigns as the acting director of the FBI, so clearly that had been at least six weeks before. You’re already engaged with Gray.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>With Pat.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, well, okay. Well, you know what I’m going to do probably after you leave. I’m going to Google up Patrick Gray. I want to see if his son, because I had a lengthy discussion with his son, has written up anything on his dad and the contacts with me. That could be invaluable, so I want to do that. I’m not going to stumble around on it any longer. We remained, you ought to know, very close friends up literally until the day he died, and I really feel like I shielded him from having gotten swallowed up in a very negative way by Watergate. It was embarrassing for him to do his little stint out there and acknowledge about the burning of the papers, but, quite frankly, that was minor. <br>
            [Brief interruption concerning lunch plans]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I don’t have the date in front of me, and I’m sorry about this, but you talked to so many important people in this investigation, and it seems to me that you end up being privy to information that later on turns out to be incredibly important in the investigation.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I have no regret about anything I said or did, was never proven wrong, and then I’m going to ask a favor in terms of Watergate. I want to stop Watergate because I want to have a talk with Bill Shure. I also want to go through some notes of my own so when we sit down I can make more sense, but this I know. This I know. Had I made one mistake, no matter how minor, I would’ve had my head taken off by the White House. I would’ve had my head taken off by the Democratic majority on the Committee, and I certainly would’ve had my head taken off by the Republicans.</p>
          <p>During the Watergate somebody made some comment or accusation against Nixon and it was proved not to be true and I remember that person literally never popped up in public print again, so I knew how important it was to be totally accurate on whatever I said or whatever comments I made. The closest I came to being almost booted off the Committee, I guess, was when I suggested that [H.R. “Bob”] Haldeman and Ehrlichman ought to resign and both Baker and Sam Ervin took me to task. Both of them did. </p>
          <p>But the reason I said what I said was that any of us are subjected to criticism based on the performance of the people that we hire. It wasn’t that these two were independent contractors. These were Richard Nixon’s choices and they represented him and this mess was created. For them to say they didn’t know anything, that just defied all common sense. That didn’t take any investigation on my part and I didn’t mind making the statement. They ought to step down and save their boss the embarrassment. Maybe if they had, the thing would’ve ended.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We can come back to some of the details about Watergate later, but one of the things I know that you will remember and can perhaps comment on, and Bill Shure talked about this in his interview, he says he remembers the most dramatic moment for him was the way Haldeman looked at you during the actual televised investigations and the kind of hostility and anger that occurred at that moment. Do you remember that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh sure.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>As one of the most significant moments for you, as well, in the hearings?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, it wasn’t just from Bill. Obviously, I noticed the hostility because he’d gotten nailed. This was over the incident of protestors, I think, cursing and booing the President on one of his visits, which he actually encouraged, he thought, to make Nixon look good. Anyway, and then whatever that exchange was. Well, yes, sure because that’s the one where my father called up and says, “Do you have any bodyguards, any security?” I said, “No.” He said, “Well, Jesus, that man looks like he’d like to kill you.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that didn’t occur to you that maybe you should retreat at that point?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. Again, that was all documented. They clearly, by the documentation, were looking forward to people that were, in effect, cursing the President of the United States so as to put the President of the United States in a good light. I mean, that’s just the most twisted thing you ever heard of, and yet it was all there, and documentation was there in the communications.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And one other thing, and then perhaps we should just quit for today, but it seems to me that one of the ways in which things began to unravel for the White House had to do with the involvement of the press and the ability of leaks to the press that then showed up and sort of dramatized this whole scenario, and you just said if you had taken one misstep, they would’ve had your head and it would’ve affected your career, but these leaks to the press were pretty carefully orchestrated, weren’t they?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, they were.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you must’ve had no idea, really, about the implications of some of this.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, yes. To me, the press was my best protector.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How so?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, just getting the truth out. Not having it spun one way or the other, either by the Committee or the President or anybody else. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But we also know that the press sometimes—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, they can, but we very carefully had developed contacts with the press who were straight up. We just didn’t hand this stuff to—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You trusted your contacts.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, sure, and they were the best protection I had in terms of getting the truth out there and forcing the hand of the White House rather than having my hand forced.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And Bill Shure said as well that the ground was shifting under you as you went, day by day. New things kept on emerging and you were constantly needing to rethink how you were going to develop your arguments and your positions.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes.Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So there was a lot of risk in this in terms of your—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, yes, there’s no question about that. But again, it was the very attitude that you and I talked about in our first interview, you know, the results be damned. In other words, I’m just going to do what I think. It doesn’t mean to say what I think is right, but what I think to be right. I’m going to go ahead and do it and let the chips fall where they may. I never worried about myself. I never did. I only worried that I would somehow have made a big mistake, but I made damn sure through my own staff and myself that that couldn’t happen. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. Do you remember when it was that you talked with Mark Felt, when in this process?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I don’t remember talking to him at all. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. I’ll have to check my notes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You better check that, because I think that my staff had contacts with him, but I didn’t talk to Felt. Not that I know of. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>All right. Maybe it was your staff that talked with Felt. I’ll have to check.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You’ll have to go and check that out. Again, I’m going to call Bill today after you leave anyway. I want to establish contact with him.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Then I think at the moment maybe we’ll just call it a day for today, unless there’s anything else.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. But this has been very helpful to me because I can see where I’ve got to do some homework here in order to make sense to you, and I will. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay, great. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I will.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you. Well, then until the next time, we’ll call it a day. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you. </p>
