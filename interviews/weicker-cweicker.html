          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Today is January 11, 2011. This is Phyllis Leffler, and I’m sitting in the home of Governor Lowell Weicker for the fifth of our interviews in the oral history series related to the Lowell Weicker Papers, and today I would like to focus on the gubernatorial years. Even though the papers don’t really focus on that, I think it’s really important in terms of the project to try to round out your larger recollections. </p>
          <p>Yesterday I was going through what we had done in the past, and actually in our first interview we had traced out your career and talked about the various stages, so I don’t think we have to talk too much about the election process, except that I do have a couple of questions that I’d like to put on the table before we actually talk about governing as Governor. The first one was about the creation of an Independent Party and how that worked for the campaign itself in the process of getting elected as Governor.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000124"></a>0:01:24</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s reasons for running for Governor as an Independent</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, having been persuaded that I should run for Governor by friends of mine, the only question that remained is how would I do it, and basically would I run as a Republican or would I run as an Independent? I had neither the time nor the money nor I believed the support within the Republican Party to follow down the road of a Republican convention and primary. Don’t forget it was the same Republican Party that basically had defeated me in the 1988 election, and the party hadn’t changed. Indeed, I would say it had become much more in the hands of the conservatives of Connecticut and more particularly, William Buckley and John Rowland. </p>
          <p>I certainly felt I had enough friends within the party that I could get the necessary percentage in a convention that enabled me to primary. I was less sure of whether I could win the primary. In any event, even less sure that I had the finances to go through that whole process, and then assuming I won, get into a general election, so that was my analysis, and on the basis of that analysis, I said, “Look, let’s just go for it, go directly onto the ballot. I knew I could get enough signatures within the state to qualify to go on the ballot, and as facts proved out, we more than tripled, I think I’m right on that, the number of signatures that were required to get on the ballot. Claudia, what did he say?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Ten times, I think.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Ten times. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I think that we needed ten thousand and you had over—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It was, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>—a hundred thousand. It’s all somewhere in the records, but it’s pretty close.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And not only that, it proved to be a terrific part of the election itself because we introduced me to the state. It got people very excited at the grassroots level, and I knew that town committees—it made no difference whether they were Republican town committees or Democratic town committees, are worthless. They serve one function and one function only—to send people to conventions, but then after the conventions are over and they’ve had their butts kissed by whoever the aspiring politicians were, they’d go home and sit on their hands for the election, whereas if you could rouse the general public, they made a hell of an effort on your behalf.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Can I add something? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Please. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>You don’t mind? The day that Lowell announced that he was going to run as an Independent the telephone at home started ringing. We never had an unlisted telephone number, and it started ringing. We kept a yellow pad, like a legal pad, by the phone and filled it within a couple of days with names and telephone numbers of people who were calling our home to volunteer. It was absolutely extraordinary, and honestly, it’s the only time that we had to unlist our telephone number because it never stopped ringing. It was unbelievable the outpouring.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So these were people who were committed to you because of your prior work and it didn’t really matter what party you were.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Right. I think that’s correct.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And that sort of proves the point of why the third party—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Of why we went in that direction, but its value, as I say, extended way beyond just getting on the ballot. This formed the core of our election when they stayed with us to work for the election. Probably the closest I could recollect to this type of an effort was [Barack] Obama’s effort and how it resonated with the young people and minorities, and nobody could prove that better than right here in the back door of Charlottesville, my youngest son, Andrew [Weicker], was part of the Obama team that was assigned Fluvanna County—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s a challenge.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And Fluvanna County, yes, you hit it, a challenge, a big Republican repository of votes. Well, Andrew and some of his young friends from the University and within that group many blacks, many blacks outside the University, they were the ones that canvassed Fluvanna. Well, as it turned out, Obama lost I think by a couple of hundred votes in Fluvanna. Unheard of. Normally carried big margins by Republicans. It’s not so much the result, it’s the enthusiasm that is brought to the table, and when that enthusiasm is lacking, then you can’t accomplish it, because nothing proved it better than the subsequent election with Creigh Deeds or whatever, and that group didn’t turn out at all. That is a classic example of what happens if you can really rev up people to get involved in politics. </p>
          <p>That was the decision. Why the name A Connecticut Party? Very simple: because that automatically puts you at the top of the ballot by using “A.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. It was just a strategy.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It was a strategy, right, to put us at the top of the ballot and not somewhere way down below. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But then fast-forward a couple of years. You then made some efforts to create a national Independence Party.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That was separate and apart, because you could not—I knew when I was Governor that I wouldn’t have the opportunity to engage in politics on behalf of A Connecticut Party, because if I did that, I’d lose any chance of getting majorities in the legislature, since the legislature was Republican or Democrat. If they saw me out there doing a thing on behalf of A Connecticut Party, that would decrease their likelihood of joining with me in legislative attempts, and that’s why I couldn’t do it. If I had done it, probably Eunice Groark could have been elected when she ran, but I didn’t and Eunice knew I didn’t, and it was the right thing to do in terms of governing the state. </p>
          <p>The matter of the Independent Party nationally, that was something entirely different. That was along with I guess Jesse Ventura and others that were making efforts to have a run at the presidency. It maybe would have had legs had not Donald Trump entered the scene, and then all of a sudden everybody says, “Well, maybe we ought to think about him. He’s got a lot of money,” which is true, but certainly as far as the individual is concerned, there was nobody that I wanted to be associated with. </p>
          <p>Having gotten on the ballot, having won as an Independent, made no further real attempt to energize a viable third party within Connecticut. Ironically, just last month in the general elections, the chairman of A Connecticut Party, a woman by the name of Diane Blick who was a good friend of mine from northwest Connecticut, was elected probate judge in her own right for the towns that she represented, so that was sort of a reminder to me as to what we used to be at one time. So that, I think, pretty well answers the question as to how we did it, why we did it— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Can I just— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>—and then why I had to cease doing it once becoming Governor.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why did you choose Eunice Groark as your running mate?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Good question. I didn’t know Eunice. Never met her. Two people were brought to me as being the most viable lieutenant governor candidates, and contrary to Rachel Pierce’s comment, she mentioned the name of the mayor of Hartford, I think Carrie Saxon Perry was her name. I never considered her. Two people that were considered were a woman legislator by the name of Edith Prague— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Can you spell that for me? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Sure. P-R-A-G-U-E—from southeastern Connecticut and a veteran legislator, and Eunice Groark, who was general counsel to the city government of Hartford. I felt that what we needed was not the old, if you will, but we needed the new, and having met her, I thought she was an extraordinarily bright young lady and could really bring some energy to the ticket and also some smarts to the ticket. She was a very, very intelligent person that thoroughly knew the issues that related to Hartford, and if you knew those, you knew every city in the state of Connecticut, because they’re all the same problems. So it was Eunice. Eunice had been suggested to me by Peter Gold, who was one of my campaign managers, and Tom also knew her, Tom D’Amore, so that was my choice. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And that turned out, obviously, to be a good choice.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>A hell of a choice. As a matter of fact, I’ve always regretted the fact that the state of Connecticut went back to its partisan ways in the subsequent election. By every poll, Eunice was viewed as being the smartest, having the most integrity, most common sense, all of those types of values, and yet she always came in third in the poll being an Independent, not as a Republican or a Democrat, and when the results came in, that’s what the results said, the Republican and the Democrat winning the nomination but, by God, can you imagine where we would be today had Eunice been the Governor and we didn’t have to go through the corruption of the [John] Rowland years and the profligacy of the Democratic legislature during those Rowland years. Between the corruption and the profligacy, believe me, there wasn’t much of a state left by the time the recently departed Governor, [M. Jodi] Rell, took over.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. Let me just ask a very broad overarching question and let you take it where you would like to. What are you most proud of, of those four years when you were Governor? What do you think are the biggest accomplishments?</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001412"></a>0:14:12</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker reflects on accomplishments as Governor</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I think there would be three answers there, really, and it would be hard for me to grade those. I succeeded not at all in one, partly in another, and fairly comprehensively in the other. I would consider my greatest achievement in which I didn’t achieve anything was to try to implement the court ruling of [Milo] <span class="court-case">Sheff v.</span> [William] <span class="court-case">O’Neill</span>, bringing the quality of educational opportunity to all the children of Connecticut. I didn’t succeed because even though I had set the train on the track and it was starting to move down the track, as soon as I left office it was totally ditched and I couldn’t achieve it during my term of office. There were two big— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Was this the idea of creating these regional districts then through—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well yes, as was later affirmed by my presence on the Century Fund Commission on Educational Opportunity, funded by the Century Fund, the segregation that we had in Connecticut was no different than it was at that time anywhere in the United States. It was economic segregation. It wasn’t racial. That doesn’t mean to say there aren’t vestiges of that, and that certainly relates to the economics. It’s economic, and it is today, also. It still is. And how do you get around that? Well, all I knew was that if anybody could do it, a small state like Connecticut could do it, and I wanted to get that on track to have the local communities, and I realized it was important that any solution should start at the local community level and then to the legislature and then to the Governor. Otherwise, the whole thing would be blown up at any given moment and we were in a very—we started off well. </p>
          <p>In other words, where I said to the boards of education in the state, “Look, you tell us how to do it. You tell us. We’re not going to come down with a great pronouncement imposing something on you.” I knew the minute we did that we’d be in court. That would be the end of the effort. Rather have the local communities and the regions and the districts give us their ideas, and that was well down the track, including the kids themselves. I wanted to make it a grassroots effort. Well, as I said, I only got to the point where we got suggestions from the local communities, and then I was out of office and then nothing further to place on that score. So I didn’t succeed, but I have to say to you that I would still be right today. I mean, today is 2011. </p>
          <p>We started this effort in 1990, roughly 1993 would be the last two years of my administration, so the time has gone by and nothing’s changed and we still have that economic segregation, so it didn’t succeed.</p>
          <p>Secondly would be the health care provisions. We tried to get a program going for health care in the state of Connecticut, especially among young people. That continues today to some degree in some of the programs in the state, so at least it was a recognition of the problem that health care was an issue. Now we know it’s a huge issue, but nothing being done at the national level, even though Hillary Clinton made her effort. We figure we should least get started on it in Connecticut, and I’m proud of the fact I did that, because to me, it was then and is now a huge issue confronting both the state, obviously, and the country, and we’re still not through those woods. I think we’ll get there. I’m optimistic. But what’s going to happen with the present legislation is that there will be aspects of it that will be amended but it will stay on track and we’ll have a system in the United States rather than the ad hoc type of care that is now doled out in one form or the other. </p>
          <p>Thirdly was the matter of disability, and most particularly, of mental disability, where I closed the training school at Mansfield, training school being the word for the warehousing of the mentally disabled and challenged. In closing that down and also implementing other ways, in other words, what became eventually the Americans With Disabilities Act, but we paid attention to that community where no attention had been paid in the past. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001949"></a>0:19:49</p>
          <p class="c-header">Establishing state income tax in Connecticut</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You probably wonder, Well, Governor, the thing that you’re most known for you don’t mention—the income tax. Well, to me, it’s not that I’m afraid to mention it. I’m very proud of the fact that we took a very regressive tax system and made it progressive. Of that, I’m proud. But that’s only something that should’ve been done. It was just a kick in the face to poorer people, and I say poorer, not poor, but the poorer. I know that it’s received a lot of negatives, but that said, I think most of the negatives came from the middle income earners in Connecticut, since they, in effect, were excluded from the capital gains and dividends tax which we eliminated, and they had no income tax, so literally all they had was a sales tax, and yet that was numerically the biggest constituency that was going tax-free in the state, and that’s where most of the anger was generated.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But on the other hand, you put the state on a path so that you were generating surpluses rather than huge deficits. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why wouldn’t you be proud of that? It seems to me it generated money to be able to do other good things within the state.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I put it in the same category, Phyllis, as Watergate. I’m so much prouder of my work on behalf of the NIH [National Institutes of Health], on behalf of NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], on behalf of AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome], on behalf of apartheid, all those things to me come ahead of Watergate, which was essentially a negative exercise. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I considered reforming the tax system in the state essentially a negative exercise. I mean, my critics say, “All he’s going to do is to go ahead and create the income tax and they’re going to spend it.” Well, to that extent, my critics were right. They spent it to the point where right now it’s $4 billion in the hole, having spent all the income tax money and all the Indian gaming money. They just rifled through it, and the people that rifled through it for the most part were the biggest opponents of it, i.e., John Rowland and leaders in the legislature.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What did they rifle through it for?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, Christ. Everything that the public thinks politicians rifle through monies for. Their own pet projects, just sort of buying their elections, giving money to constituents in whatever form.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But surely, an income tax—I understand the larger point you’re making, but surely an income tax that generates a large amount of money, those monies can then be used for things like better health care and education.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Sure, if you have an enlightened leadership. Yes, absolutely, it can.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you don’t feel those monies were ever used in that way.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, I think it’s been horrendous. I mean, look where we are, what we’re confronting now.  When I went into office, when I was elected—you’ve got to grant me leeway on this, but I’m pretty sure. Actually, on Election Day I think we had about a $100 million deficit somewhere, or thereabouts. By the time I was sworn in, that amount was doubled, and then doubled again even before I got my feet on the ground, so let’s generously use a figure of a billion. The state today is $4 billion. </p>
          <p>The incumbent Governor, Dannel Malloy, I’d like to know what he’s going to do to get out of the hole. He can’t impose an income tax because that’s been done. He can raise it, but he can’t impose it. He can’t go ahead and redo the Indian gaming deals. They’re done, so where’s he going to get it? Well, he’s going to have to get it by cutting spending and raising taxes, which is not going to be a very easy task. But—what was the thought on my mind there?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is all part of your explaining of why you don’t consider the income tax— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No, I don’t consider it— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So what you’re saying is that there wasn’t real fiscal responsibility that was exercised.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. There was none, there really wasn’t, and as I said, as I repeated, when I left—  Oh, I know what I wanted to say. So for years after I left the governorship people would come up and say, “Oh, you’re the guy that went ahead and imposed the income tax.” Finally this year during the election I heard that a couple of times in places I had appeared. I had the Tea Party, that’s right. They went ahead and picketed me when I had a couple of radio interviews. I turned to the guys, I said, “Listen, you’ve had 19 years to repeal it. You haven’t repealed it. You spent it. So I don’t want to be carrying the blame anymore on this thing.” If it was no good, they could have gotten rid of it right away, especially having elected a Governor who was dedicated to no income tax, John Rowland, so why didn’t they do it? They had too much fun spending it, and now, of course, the tax had been raised by the previous Governor and I’m sure it’s going to have to be raised again by this Governor. </p>
          <p>You can’t run a state on the sales tax unless you want to have the alternative that confronted me, which was had I balanced the budget on the sales tax when I took office, we would have to raise the sales tax in Connecticut to 13 percent, and that was just unheard of in those days, so that’s not the solution.</p>
          <p>No. We’re where we ought to be, and I’m glad that I put that system into place. I’m sure there are a lot of people that are still pissed off. They ought to look at themselves and not at others. They have every right to say we don’t trust those in government to prudently handle the monies. I can’t argue against that because they didn’t prudently handle it, but they have no right to say that the system is wrong. The system is right. The people are the ones that are wrong. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Health care accomplishments as Governor</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Could you be a little more specific about the health care accomplishments? You said you’re very proud of those. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Boy, that’s one thing. You know, I should, and I’m trying to think who can give you a better read on all aspects of that. Probably Sue Addiss, who was my public health commissioner. She’s at Yale University and lives in New Haven. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, maybe I could get up there. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Or call her. I’m trying to think of who else would be—Al Solnit, who was my mental health commissioner, would’ve been ideal, too, because our plan included not just physical disability but mental disability. He’s dead. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So when you talk about health care, you’re really talking about expanding—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Modest programs that took care of the most vulnerable—children. Now that program has been continued. I don’t know what they call it now. It was called SustiNet, I think, but that’s why I need somebody to carry the ball on this one for me because it was very modest, but we wanted to get a start on it. I think at the same time, if I’m not mistaken, I endorsed Senator [Hillary Rodham] Clinton coming forth with national health care.</p>
          <p>I know Ted Kennedy and I put in the first bill on health care. First let me say this. If there are people that you want to get a hold of, and not only get a hold of, but you have not interviewed and you should interview them, there is a fellow by the name of Tom Dudchik. Tom Dudchik was on my staff as a United States Senator. He then went with me to Hartford, where he was a deputy in a couple of agencies and eventually deputy chief of staff. He literally gave up his college career for me and didn’t go to college until I left the governorship. He has managed to put together the most comprehensive Web site on Connecticut government and politics. There’s nothing like it in the state of Connecticut. There’s nothing like it in most states, as a matter of fact. [Weicker looks for Web site and gives Leffler Dudchik’s phone number] It’s called <span class="work-title">Capitol Report</span>, and it just covers all aspects of Connecticut government and politics.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you think he could—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>He can do two things for you. Number one, he would be a font of information as to my years, both in the Senate and in the governorship, and he has kept close track of the whereabouts of ex-staffers. [discussion of connections to Sue Addiss omitted] Clearly he’s somebody you really should talk to because he does span both areas. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. So accomplishments—you’re listing education, health care, disability legislation, and we talked some about the income tax. What would you say are your biggest disappointments from those years as Governor?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think I’ve answered that question with somebody else. It would be the failure to achieve education reform. I think we should have been able to do that. I think the reason why we didn’t was that my normal allies on the Democratic side of the aisle just were plain tired from the income tax battle and they were not prepared to take on a controversial issue like economic desegregation. In other words, one was enough in any four years. I can understand it. I’m not blaming them in any way. I can understand that. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Gambling and gaming in Connecticut</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The records are very clear about your disagreement with the gambling policies and establishing gaming in Connecticut. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Right. Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You’re on the record in various interviews making the distinction between gaming and family values, for example. Could you just talk about that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, sure, I’d be glad to go ahead and talk about it. As you know, before I took office, the Indian group, being the Mashantucket Pequots, had won a decision in federal court that allowed them to do the same thing that was done by the residents of the state of Connecticut. You say to me, “Well, Lowell, what’s that?” We had a law in Connecticut called Monte Carlo Night, and you could have table games in any institution, for a one night a year have regular gambling table games, so basically the federal court said that if that’s okay for the people of the state of Connecticut, then it’s also okay for the Indian tribe. What it doesn’t include, obviously, is the biggest moneymaker, slot machines. It just includes craps, blackjack, all those kinds of games. No video poker. No slot machines. </p>
          <p>The Indians were very happy with that decision by the federal courts, and when I took office I was confronted with having to choose between—well, let me track back. After I took office, a man by the name of Charlie Duffy who was an attorney for the Indians came to my assistant chief of staff, Stan Twardy. Stan had been with me in Washington. He was a brilliant young lawyer. “Claudia, did Stan go to the U.S. Attorney’s office between Washington and Hartford or after Hartford?” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span><span class="contactmethod">[in other room]</span> He was U.S. Attorney. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He was U.S. Attorney, she said. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. When did he get appointed U.S.— ? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span><span class="contactmethod">[in other room]</span> After he was attorney— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I’m sorry. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span><span class="contactmethod">[in other room]</span> What? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Was Stan U.S. Attorney—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span><span class="contactmethod">[in room]</span> —for the state of Connecticut. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I know. When? Between Washington and Hartford or after Hartford? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, no. Between Washington and Hartford.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Okay, so he was U.S. Attorney also. Duffy approached Stan and said, “Look, is there any way that we can compromise? We’re prepared to take this whole matter back into federal court looking for slot machines.” And Stan came and, “We want to know if there’s any way that we could effectuate a compromise without having to go to the lawsuit.” I told Stan, I said, “Geez, I don’t like the whole gambling idea, but I’ll think about it,” and I didn’t like the whole idea. I just didn’t. I was one of those that was disappointed in the federal court decision and did not want to have gambling either in the form of table games or more sophisticated forms such as slot machines. Then it was indicated to me that they would be glad if they could have slot machines to give a substantial sum off the top.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Back to the state?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Back to the state, and no strings attached. Well, that really gave me pause, because what if we went to court and we lost again? Then they were in place—without having to pay a nickel. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And I think that what I had to do was to go ahead and resolve in my own mind my own feelings for the matter and my instincts as to what would be the best for the state of Connecticut. I’m going to get back to this in a minute to show you my continued opposition to the gambling. So we struck a deal, and giving them slot machines, and I think the take was somewhere around 25 percent. It might be 23, 24, or 25 percent, somewhere in there, which has proven to be a huge revenue boom to the state of Connecticut. </p>
          <p>Now, along came the Mohegans, and they had been recognized as a tribe. At that stage of the game, the Mashantuckets could have proven to be a big obstacle because we, in effect, had given them exclusive right to gambling. The Mashantuckets figured it’s in our interest to share with our fellow Indian tribe and they did, and so they said it’s okay.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why was it in their interest to share?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I suppose in their interest of— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>supporting Native American— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>supporting Native Americans or whatever. They didn’t put up any— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>fight. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>—opposition here at all. They said, “Look, it’s something we want to go ahead and do.” So they did, and obviously between the two of them it’s meant enormous revenues to the state. Along comes the man that I mentioned before on the Independent presidential movement, Donald Trump, and he in effect says, “Listen, hey, this is all a joke. These Indians are not Indians. They’re blacks.” There’s no question about the fact— Yes, Claudia. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>“They don’t look like Indians to me.” [quoting Donald Trump]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, well— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Is that what he said?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really? I don’t remember that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, sure. Because they were black. Well, most of them. Claudia— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>To [Richard] Skip Hayward. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Because what had happened in the evolution of all this is both the blacks and the Indians were excluded from American society.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course, and so there had been a lot of—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And so there’d been a lot of intermarriage. “Well,” he said, “they don’t look like Indians to me,” so he said, “I want to open up a casino in Bridgeport, Connecticut.” And, boy, all the town fathers of Bridgeport thought this was a great idea, including a man by the name of Ernie Trefz who had been a good friend of mine and who owned just about all the McDonald’s, in Connecticut. He thought this would be super for Bridgeport. I said to Ernie and to the fathers of Bridgeport and the mayor and everybody else, “No. We’ve got to rebuild Bridgeport, but we’re not doing it on the back of gambling.” It just isn’t the way to go. It never has been the way to go where an economy depends only on gambling. There’s not much to show for it, really, thinking specifically of Atlantic City, and now the way that had gone. In any event, I denied that, that a state would not, because that would have to be a state issue. </p>
          <p>Do you follow what I’m talking about? Not Indians, but the state would then have to officially get into the gambling business, and I said no. That’s what sort of reaffirmed my initial position on gambling, having accommodated to the position that was thrust upon me by the federal courts and also then by the fiscal needs of the state of Connecticut. So that’s the story on gambling, and it’s proven to be a very successful story. I think others have since, once again, tried to open the door to gambling in Bridgeport. I don’t think it’s had much success.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So in retrospect, you’re not feeling that it was a bad idea ultimately? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>A hell of an idea. [Interruption as Weicker and Leffler close a window and discuss matters unrelated to interview] Did I make lemonade out of the lemons? Yes, I did, I think. [Claudia Weicker unrolls packing tape in background] And again, all I can say to those that—I think most of the people in the state of Connecticut would also agree, even if they’re opposed to the income tax, they love the Indian gaming monies. Now, clearly, they’ve taken a nosedive during the tough times that impacted on retail, which would have lowered the sales tax revenues and also has lowered the Indian gaming revenues, but they’re still pretty substantial.<br>

          <p class="c-header">Business climate in Connecticut</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In your State of the State Address in 1994, you listed one of your accomplishments as providing a better business climate for Connecticut. Would you still say that’s one of your accomplishments?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Sure. We were killing business when I took over. High corporate taxes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So the tax policy has really changed that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, because everybody loves to talk about raising the income tax. On the other hand, there were huge tax cuts and the main beneficiaries of those were the corporations and the executives of corporations. When we eliminated the capital gains dividends tax, it was far less expensive for them to pay normal income taxes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And the sales tax. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And the sales tax, Claudia says.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, and what? About a half a percent, I think? Yes, it was about a half a percent. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>A reduction?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, a reduction.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>But it would have had to go way up. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No, I already told that to Phyllis. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who were the state legislators who were most helpful to you during the gubernatorial years?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Certainly the number one that stands out is Richard Balducci, and you’ll have a chance to talk to him because he’s the other partner of Tom D’Amore and John Doyle, so if you can ever get a visit to Hartford to get all three of them in the room at the same time, believe me, that’s a treasure trove. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, I’ll have— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Rich Balducci would be number one as to being a real help during the entire gubernatorial years. </p>
          <p>Number two would be a man by the name of Tom Ritter who also was one of the main players in the State House of Representatives. In the State Senate would have been Bill DiBella. DiBella was more of a political type. Billy was clearly a political type, [conversation about spelling of name] much more of a political type, very skillful. There was no question about that, and a good guy. I liked Bill DiBella. He’s a nice guy. A lot of people thought he was on the narrow edge from time to time, but he always dealt fairly with me. I have nothing but good to say about him. Those were the three main players in the legislature.</p>
          <p>When you say in the political sense, that certainly would have included Bill Cibes, who was my budget director [phone rings] in the State House.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>He was well known to the legislators, having been a member of their leadership.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, and when he came in, I read people immediately said, “Oh, this means you’re going to have an income tax.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s right. Well, he campaigned on that among the Democrats. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Irv Stolberg.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No, Claudia, not in a leadership sense. I’m not saying he didn’t vote for it, there were a lot of Democrats that voted for it, but there were a lot of Republicans, too. I’m trying to think— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>He was the one who supposedly fathered the income tax and supported it forever.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I’m trying to think on the Republican side if there was somebody that—</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Could you say that name again?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Irv Stolberg—because I don’t think that’s fair anymore than— I didn’t put in Miles Rapoport. Miles was way ahead of Irv on advocacy within the house, but I’ve listed the leadership that made things happen.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Okay. On the Republican side, Bill Nickerson?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. No. Bill voted for it, but Bill was not—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Did anyone on the Republican side advocate for it?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, sure. Hey, Larry Bettencourt gave up his seat to go ahead and do it. I’m trying to think—there was a leader. [M. Adela] Dell Eads, God rest her soul, was no help at all. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>What about from West Hartford? Who was—Bob Farr? Was it—no?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think I’ve given you—as a matter of fact—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>What about Claudia Powers? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s the Greenwich delegation. They were a hundred percent for it because it was beneficial to their constituencies. My response to you is you want a sit-down session with Doyle—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Doyle with Tom D’Amore and Rich Balducci on this.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>D’Amore, Balducci. She wants to talk to John Doyle anyway, so Balducci, Doyle, D’Amore [contact information given] That’s a rich trove, really, because it covers politics and government, and that’s why it’s good. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Stand on gun rights</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>One of the issues that I know you were very concerned about was gun violence, and obviously, given what’s happened—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I don’t know that much happened, did it?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, in the last couple of days something’s happened in terms of gun rights—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, no, you mean—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you were saying that that was an important issue for you in terms of—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think it was in Connecticut. I think it is in the United States.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And also in terms of controlling the sale of guns.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No question about it. I can’t remember what we did, but to me, it’s always been an issue. Nobody except law enforcement or the military should have handguns, okay? Nobody. I have no problem with long guns. I don’t want to interfere with legitimate sportsmen, and that’s exactly what the long gun is for, but when it comes to assault weapons and handguns, nobody should have them except for law enforcement and the military, and you’re right. </p>
          <p>Look what’s happened in the last 48 hours. Unbelievable. But I can’t believe—I’m also going to make an analogy here in a minute, but it’s just inconceivable to me that the citizenry is actually empowered by the law to carry concealed weapons as they are in Arizona, and indeed, right now in Arizona, they are seeking to amend the law to go ahead and allow faculty and students to carry on campuses. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know this— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>This country’s insane.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s when I retire. [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I don’t blame you. But the same thing, I might add, when they had the Virginia Tech shooting here, the same argument was taking place on radio talk shows in Connecticut, that we ought to not only have them, but we ought to have them on college campuses, faculty and students. Look, there’s absolutely no reason—and of course, two things have exacerbated this whole scenario: number one was the most recent Supreme Court decision, which in effect voided gun laws in D.C., and then number two, the atmosphere, the rhetoric of hate and violence that absolutely permeates the country right now. </p>
          <p>As you know, after I got my income tax, I went out to talk to the people on the lawn of the State Capitol in Hartford and I was surrounded by 40,000 people that were so pissed and waving their fists. I had to be dragged out there because people started to take a swing at me. Well, how do you think that would have been if the State of Connecticut had laws allowing those people to just carry guns with them? I mean there is no justification, none whatsoever. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Somebody threw a bottle at me at that night, remember?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, that was when we were at the theater in New London.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I think they were aiming for you, but missed. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No, now we don’t know that. I don’t know what we did, though. I can’t remember that, Phyllis. I don’t. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I just thought it was so powerful. You actually ended your 1994 state of the state speech, and I’m going to quote it, saying: “Our task is to rid this society, not just of the reverberating violence of its guns but the silent violence of unaddressed sickness, ignorance, and joblessness.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Right. True.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Very, very powerful statement, I think.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, but it’s true. I’m citing, no, I suppose I’m paraphrasing, so I don’t take all the credit, either [Mohandas] Gandhi, the same thing with violence, the violence of poverty, or I think Martin Luther King also, if I’m not mistaken. But I feel that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you don’t really remember whether you made—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Was there a legislative—I don’t know.</p>

          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s opposition to the death penalty</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I don’t recall. I think you were looking ahead saying that’s another task that has to be accomplished, but you also were on record as opposing the extension of the death penalty.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I’ve always been against the death penalty, and there was one man on death row.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And in Connecticut, do you feel—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>In light of the Petit case? I still would be against it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, I’m actually asking if you feel you made progress in the years when you were Governor.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I don’t think so, really. We didn’t do anything I don’t think.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, you spoke about it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I spoke about it, but I was certainly against—well, don’t forget, we had—this I do know. I’m almost positive we had one member on death row in Connecticut while I was Governor. We had nobody convicted and sentenced to death, but there was one person on death row. Those were being appealed, and so I never had the decision to make if his appeals had run out whether to commute the sentence. I would have, quite frankly, had that happened because I’m against it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Now, a couple of other questions. In a 1994 interview that you did with the L.A. Times, you spoke about the distinction between a politics of accountability and a politics of electability, which I thought was a very clever turn of phrase, and you said that—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s the problem right now. Exactly what you’ve got right now. For at least a decade or more, we’ve been practicing the politics of electability. It’s as simple as that. Accountability is just out the window. Say anything you want to. Do anything to get elected. Do whatever you want to, say whatever you want to against your opponent. Say whatever you want to as to what you’re about. I mean there’s just total electability. It’s the finger to the wind. It’s the politics by polls and that’s something I’ve never had much truck with. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did you ever feel you had to engage in various ways in the politics of electability?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No, not in that way. Most of it, no, because the clearest issue that I can cite to you—[Weickers discuss getting rid of some publications] You should give one to Phyllis, only because they’re the <span class="work-title">State Register &amp; Manual</span>. I’m not in this particular set obviously, but they have all the statistics of the state and everything to do with it, and you might like one. If you’ve got an extra one, Claudia, give one away. You might find some arcane point of view, in other words, historically. All the history of the state is there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you really don’t feel—governing is the art of compromise, obviously.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, but let me give you an example as to why polls don’t mean anything. Compromise is different from poll reading. [Claudia hands Phyllis a copy of book] You’ll like that book, as a matter of fact. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you. Oh, I see it’s 2009. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Phyllis, you may do what you like with that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Prayers in school. There’s not a single poll that hasn’t been taken that doesn’t show the American public by 90 percent, 85 percent, 80 percent, in favor of prayers in schools, so why would I go out there and contest Jesse Helms on the subject and beat him on it and beat Ronald Reagan on it? Because I think it’s absolutely crucial to the Constitution of the United States and to how we conduct ourselves as a nation to make sure that religion is not merged with the state. I might add, my friend John Rowland, who was convicted of corruption and went to jail—if you can believe this; apparently, you’ve got to be a felon to make some money in this world—has a radio program in the state called “Church and State.” It’s conducted by him and his pastor, who saved him from—</p>
          <p>[Interruption for phone call] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We had been talking about the distinction between the politics of accountability and the politics of electability. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, and I responded that the good example was the church/state issue. There’s no winning that fight with the public, I’ll guarantee you.</p>

          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs] </p>

[laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you’re not going to tell us the story. He said you were going to tell me.</p>

I know you’ve overheard this whole conversation about the—we haven’t really talked about the issues that you involved yourself in during those gubernatorial years, so maybe you could just talk about them a little bit in terms of what issues you paid attention to aside from being the First Lady of Connecticut.</p>

          <p class="c-header">Claudia Weicker promotes abortion rights and women’s health issues</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, I tried to give a public face to issues that involved women and women’s health. I was actively pro-choice. I spoke publicly on the matter of choice. I spoke largely about the needs of our children in the state of Connecticut, particularly those who had less opportunity and basically the economic concerns. I tried to make the nexus between what’s good social policy and what’s good economic policy.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did your speaking out on the pro-choice issues have repercussions?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Not really. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s pretty remarkable.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>We allowed NARAL [National Abortion and Rights Action League], the state—  NARAL and—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What is that? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>NARAL, the National Abortion Rights Action League. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>—the Connecticut NARAL to have a fundraiser at the Governor’s residence, and then we were contacted by one of the right-to-life organizations to use the Governor’s residence, and Lowell said that we absolutely had to do it, so we did. But I never felt—Connecticut largely is about 50 percent Catholic, but it’s also a very pro-choice state. I served on the national board of NARAL while Lowell was Governor. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I served on the board of the National Mental Health Association. They changed their name nationally in recent years. I don’t know exactly what they call themselves today, but I served on that board as well. I served on an advisory board at Yale on children’s mental health issues and I was the honorary chair of the Connecticut Commission on Children’s School Readiness Campaign and spoke a lot about children’s issues. I volunteered in soup kitchens and initially, too, I also spoke about— </p>
          <p>In reviewing all of these albums the other day, I came across a reference to a speech that I gave which included supporting the income tax publicly. I tried to balance what was necessary for me to do at home with our children and Lowell publicly and what I could do outside, and I basically stuck to issues that I was comfortable with because I had worked on them in Washington, so health and education and women’s health really fit very well with what I had done when I was working in Washington.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Just to play devil’s advocate here for a moment, some might see those as traditional gendered issues—women’s rights, health, education kinds of things. Did you feel limited in that way because you were the spouse of a Governor? Or were those simply the issues [phone rings] that interested you? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I suppose you’d say that they are typical gender issues, soft issues, maybe. I don’t think choice is a soft issue, though. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, no. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And I don’t think that there were many first ladies or Senate wives who spoke publicly on those issues. I remember speaking at a large political rally in Greenwich right before the election, I believe in 1992. Both Lowell and I spoke on behalf of—it was a pro-choice rally right before the election down at Bruce Park, so in that way, I think it’s one of the reasons why I tried to concentrate my interests in these issues and tie them to the economic benefits which would accrue to the state by paying attention to them. </p>
          <p>Connecticut had, and still does have, three or four of the poorest cities in the country in the top 25 rankings. At that time I think it had three of the top ten, so anything that would elevate this. My audience was largely business people, for the most part, when I spoke, or unions, and I just felt that it was an important issue to raise. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you didn’t feel any major repercussions from speaking out on the pro-life issues as the wife of a sitting Governor?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No, I didn’t. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s terrific.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I didn’t. In fact, the day that Lowell was walking into that mob on the capitol lawn, I was speaking inside the capitol that morning. I had made a much earlier commitment to speak at the capitol to a large group on women’s issues in one of the chambers. I testified before the legislature on children’s health issues. I testified once with Lowell. Even after Lowell had left office, I went back. There was an issue that came up involving whether or not the University of Connecticut Medical Center should align with St. Francis Hospital. If it had done so, it would have meant that abortions could not be performed at the hospital, that their doctors would not be able to offer contraceptive services, that they would have to follow the practices of any Catholic hospital had the University hospital aligned with that. I went and it was during the time that I was having chemotherapy, but I went up to Hartford at the request of NARAL and testified against that merger. And it was ultimately turned down.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Turned down?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Turned down. The legislature would not allow it to occur. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, not allow it to occur. So you succeeded?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>At least, yes, the people I represented at that point or spoke on behalf of succeeded in making their point, and I felt very strongly about that. Rape victims would not be able to appear at the University of Connecticut Hospital Center and receive a morning-after pill. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That was very important. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes. So, that’s what I did.</p>

          <p class="c-header">Ramifications of supporting abortion rights and unwed mothers</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I think there’s another one that you followed through on which had an interesting background was your two sisters who wanted to run a soup kitchen.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>There were two nuns, Sisters of St. Joseph, Sister Maureen and Sister Theresa, who ran a soup kitchen called The House of Bread, but they also ran a number of social service programs for young mothers, teenage mothers, unwed mothers. They provided daycare services. They provided GED [General Equivalency Diploma] programs and office training skills programs for these young women, and I think they operated a shelter for abused women. Two issues came up. I had met them several times and had gone and seen some of the programs they had in downtown Hartford. </p>
          <p>The new Archbishop of Connecticut was a man by the name of [Daniel A.] Cronin who was being installed as Archbishop of Connecticut. The diocese is in Hartford, and Lowell was prevailed upon to give a reception for the incoming archbishop at the Governor’s residence. The morning of the reception I turned to Lowell and I said, “Who are we going to know here other than the members of the legislature?” and he said, “I don’t know, there’s a list.” He said, “Why don’t you invite those two nuns you’re always telling me about?” And I said, “Fine, I’ll call them.” They were delighted to come. They were delighted to be invited. They were very outgoing and they were well known, actually, in the political community within Hartford. </p>
          <p>They came. We had a little receiving line and Lowell was standing next to the archbishop and I was standing just before Lowell. As the nuns were coming through the receiving line, I introduced them to my husband who then introduced them to the archbishop. The archbishop looked at them, shook their hands, and then promptly turned his back on them and starting talking to the person next to him, and I thought, Well, this is really very strange. It’s also insulting, since they’re our guests here. I felt really offended and I felt embarrassed for the two nuns. As it turned out, toward the end of Lowell’s term in office, an issue came up before the archdiocese. The two nuns, The House of Bread, wanted to establish in downtown Hartford in a building adjacent and owned by one of the churches in downtown Hartford—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It was the church. It was their parish hall.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes, in the parish hall of St. Anthony/St. Patrick Church, which is smack in the middle of downtown Hartford in the central district near the convention center at that time. They wanted to establish a homeless shelter and they petitioned. The church was all for this. They had petitioned the archdiocese for permission to do so and the archdiocese—it was in the paper, we were at home in Greenwich that morning. Lowell picked up the Hartford Courant and the front page article—the archdiocese had turned down the petition on behalf of The House of Bread, saying it would be unseemly to locate a homeless shelter in the commercial area of downtown Hartford. Lowell turned to me and he said, “I want you to get those two nuns on the telephone right now.” It’s seven o’clock in the morning.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They’d be up.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I got them on the telephone and he talked to them and he said, “I want you to be in my office at nine o’clock this morning because I’m going to a bond commission meeting and I’m going to see if we can’t do something to help you establish a homeless shelter in Hartford.” And so two or three hours later it was done without the archdiocese because the state had a vacant building.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s amazing. So it wasn’t in the parish hall?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No, it was in a different location. The other thing about the reception that we gave for the archbishop, Archbishop Cronin, literally, he used the occasion to upbraid Lowell and Lowell’s position on abortion, and I thought he was a bit crass. It was totally inappropriate. Certainly, Lowell’s history of support for the issue was well established, and the archbishop was not going to be changing Lowell’s mind, but the archbishop was, I thought, very aggressive in putting forth his view to the Governor and inappropriately so in a reception we were giving in his honor. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So Cronin would’ve been opposed to this homeless shelter?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, I’m sure he was. I never sat down with the nuns afterwards to ask them what the history of this was, but clearly there was some history here, and the archdiocese was less than friendly toward anything that these nuns did, and now these nuns, they may as well have been working in a third world country. I mean, they were working among the poorest of the poor, the neediest in the city of Hartford, which was right in the top ten of the cities of the United States in terms of poverty, and there was just great need and they were fulfilling it. I don’t understand why the suits weren’t helping them, basically, so it was—but, no, I never actually had any difficulty in putting forth my view on any of these issues, and as I said, even using the occasion early on to speak at least once on the income tax and what it meant to the state. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s terrific, because I’m sure there are many women in the position of spouses who feel very constrained, but clearly it has a lot to do with who the Governor was.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, Lowell was always very encouraging. It’s just a matter of how much can you handle at one time, and I was somewhat circumspect in what I would take on. I didn’t want to take on an issue that, number one, I was lukewarm about. I didn’t want to take on too many presentation issues. I did a lot of presentations and a lot of ribbon cutting, but on the other hand, I really felt that if I was going to become involved in something, I wanted to be able to put myself into it, and all the comments that I made publicly were mine. Lowell’s office never wrote anything for me. I wrote all of my own speeches and I only really had one assistant who kept track of my schedule, and I felt that it was just a great opportunity. I felt it actually was far more interesting being first lady than it was ever being a Senate wife. A Senate wife, you are totally anonymous. I mean, to meld into the background.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It’s to roll bandages.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>[laughs] That’s true. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course, before you were a Senate wife, you were a major staffer.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I was a staffer, and I wanted an opportunity to use what skills I thought I had. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you were able to. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And if I was spreading myself too thin, I would be totally ineffective in speaking on the one or two issues that I felt I really could have an impact on. So I campaigned for people. I campaigned for my husband all over the state. I think I visited practically every senior center in the state of Connecticut at one time or another and I made a point of trying to go back to a lot of them, too, because they see political people come and go. I mean, they come during the campaign season, but do they ever go back? A few them I really did go back to and have lunch and see the people again and thank them.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it sounds like for you these were good years in terms of your sense of involvement, your role?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>[laughs] Claudia is always pissing and moaning, so I figure just look at those albums, you’ll see how good—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>She’s pretty positive right now talking about what she did.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, you haven’t seen the albums, for God’s sake.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, no, I am. I think that they were good years in many ways. They were. I think it was hard on the family.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Harder than the Senate years because it was so much more public?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>The family is not public domain as much in the Senate as it is in the Governor’s—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And how old were your children during those years, the collective family?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I think Andrew was 7 when Lowell was elected, so that meant Mason and Sonny were 12 and Trey was 11, so they were—</p>

          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>They were young, and the hardest things—Andrew was always very vocal about saying whatever he wanted to say. The first year, the Governor’s residence was literally in very sad shape. The first reception we held there we weren’t living there yet, but we held a reception for Senator [Daniel] Inouye from Hawaii who had just become chairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and was making a trip to Connecticut to visit our defense contractors, a big deal for Connecticut, which is a big defense state. We held a reception for him with members of the legislative leadership there, and in the middle of the reception, a one-by-one-foot-square piece of the living room ceiling came crashing down—</p>

          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And that began a major inspection of the house, which had been bought by the state in the middle of World War II. Everything that went into it was surplus war material. It was all very shoddy. The electricity needed to be replaced. The bathrooms and the plumbing throughout the house had to be redone, and the kitchen was basically a 1950s kitchen with a 1930s refrigerator. If you wanted to get ice cream— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>—you had to go to a freezer in the basement. The stove caught fire a couple of times. It was an old electric stovetop. It was a mess, really, and it was something that we began a project to refurbish it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But not while you were living there?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Partly while we were living there. The first six months we lived in Greenwich and they redid all the plumbing and the electricity, painted the rooms, but it was really a 3½-year program. It took up most of Lowell’s governorship before we even had draperies on the windows. I established a Governor’s Residence Conservancy to oversee the house, the residence, both to refurbish it and to restore it, raise money privately. We raised probably close to $400,000 privately, either in cash or in kind. For instance, a number of wallpaper manufacturers and fabric houses donated fabrics, Brunschwig &amp; Fils and Osbourne &amp; Little, to re-do rooms in the house, and there were simple things. </p>
          <p>The University of Connecticut had a collection of furniture. This is where John Casteen actually comes into play. John Casteen told me shortly after Lowell became Governor that the Thomas Benton Museum at the University of Connecticut had been given a collection of Connecticut and New England furniture from a wealthy donor. I met the curator and they agreed to loan major pieces of Connecticut and New England furniture to the Governor’s residence. We opened the Governor’s residence for public tours that first year that Lowell was Governor. We had a Christmas tour. I invited the Connecticut florists to decorate the house for the first time and open it up to the public so that they could see what had been going on. It was the first public event, public tour, since I think the 1940s when it was first bought, and we had five thousand people come through in one weekend. </p>
          <p>Andrew, who was by this time 8 years old, was downstairs, and the kids were milling around with all these people coming through. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Courageous.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>A very nice little lady turned to Andrew, and how adults are, they get down in the face of the child and ask them a question. “Now tell me: What’s it like to live here?” Andrew looked at her and said—and this is in the middle of living room, there are hundreds of people around—“Living here isn’t as nice as it looks.” [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And he was no doubt right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>It’s true, and so out of the mouths of babes—so you have your ups and downs. There are good days and bad days living in the Governor’s residence.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Like Sonny’s comment. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Right, about the budget. It’s on tape.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Did I tell you this one already?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s in your book, actually. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>About this is “bullshit,” about the budget. What’s the plaque underneath the plaque there? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>This one is the Martin Luther King Award for Distinguished Service.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>When is that from?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Lowell spoke on January 13, 1989. Presented to Lowell P. Weicker on the Occasion of the 60th Birthday and Fourth National Holiday in Honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Why was it 1989? I thought you spoke in 1988. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I thought I spoke earlier at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. The only Republican I think who’s ever been invited to speak down there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Is that right, do you think?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I am not so sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I was then. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes. Anyway, so yes, there were good days and bad. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure sounds like you had your hands full. Sound like it was an amazing task between the things you were doing and the focus on the mansion and then the children. It seems like a huge— </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="012748"></a>1:27:48</p>
          <p class="c-header">Challenge of hosting official events at Governor’s residence</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>The state had seen some financial crisis and there was no cook at the Governor’s residence. There was no cook.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. I’ve read that in the book too, that there was no cook. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>She was the cook.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Was that by choice or by necessity? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, my God, there was no way we were going to hire a cook in the middle of all the controversy over the income tax. It was by choice. I think the last—Ella Grasso had dismissed the cook when she was Governor, and the O’Neill’s [William O’Neill] who followed Grasso were a couple and they largely ate out or there were receptions that were catered at the residence.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>The Meskills [Thomas Meskill] never had a cook. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>The Meskills did have a cook, I think. No, they didn’t. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Okay. I think [John] Dempsey was the last one to have a cook, and I gathered he had a very well-run household, so it was both by choice and by necessity that there’s no cook, and not so bad once the kitchen was redone, but in that old kitchen, I mean, literally, any time you wanted something from a freezer you had to go to the basement for ice or whatever it was and the refrigerator was a 1930s something—Crosby.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Crosby. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs] That’s amazing.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>A double-doored little fridge. We gave a dinner party for some—the main job for Governor, to set the general policy for the state, is economic development, especially in bad times, and we gave a dinner party and had the heads of several major corporations.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you were the cook for those events, too? Oh my goodness. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I was, and I made this dinner. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s amazing to me. Not a caterer?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Without a caterer. I think we had somebody come in and serve. There were about a half a dozen corporate heads from around various businesses around Connecticut, and I remember Gini Bantle, whose husband was Lou Bantle, the head of U.S. Tobacco, headquartered in Greenwich, wandered into the kitchen at one point and she went back and she said, “Lou, you have got to see where she’s cooking.” The next thing I knew Lou Bantle called and said, “How much will it cost to have a new kitchen for the Governor’s residence?” And that really started it all. That was a major contribution, but, yes, I cooked. I cooked for the family. I cooked for State Legislators during the income tax crisis. I cooked for business leaders. I cooked for cocktail receptions. That first Christmas I think we had three or four different—one for the press, one for the legislature, one for the general public.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You didn’t do this all four years, did you?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No. I didn’t do it all. After the first year and a half—I did a lot of it. I still did a lot of it, but after the first year and half, for the big, big receptions we had a caterer come in.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s amazing. I should hope so. That is remarkable. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>But once the financial situation in the state began to improve—</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="013142"></a>1:31:42</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s position on availability of higher education</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I do have one question that I also wanted to put on the table, and it has to do with higher education, because clearly you were very focused on K-12 education. What would you say was the situation in terms of funding for higher education during those years?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>If I’m not mistaken, and I’d have to go ahead and review, that I wanted the state to actually get into the business of funding higher education, too. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I think—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I’ve always felt that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m wondering, given your close connection with John Casteen during those years he was president of the University of Connecticut.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No, he’d left.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He came to UVA in 1990.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>He checked out on me as president.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s right, exactly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>When Lowell ran. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So he wouldn’t have overlapped with you at all during that time. But he would have while you were still in the Senate.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>It seems to me that Lowell—I think you would have to check on this, but it seems to me what I recall—clearly there wasn’t a great deal of funding to give to higher education at the time, but the one thing that you pushed for was more autonomy for the state university system.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Just philosophically, and I can’t relate this to anything I did as Governor or Senator, I always believed quite frankly that higher education ought to be free also. I think education ought to be.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Free. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Public all the way through. You can still have your private universities, but there ought to be opportunity for any kid in America to go to college. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>My husband asked me to ask you whether the prominence of athletics for the University of Connecticut was anything you actively got started?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. N-O, no. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That was strictly John Rowland. We didn’t have great sports teams, and very frankly, I subscribed to the Yale theory, being a Yale man, that you go to school for academics and sports are secondary and, quite frankly, I don’t think the competition between Yale/Harvard and Yale/Princeton has diminished because we don’t have teams that go to the Rose Bowl. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Indeed. I couldn’t agree more with that. But I think it probably was—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And the best thing that could happen to the program down here is have UVA join the Ivy League.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Here, here. I totally agree. Is there anything else you want to add in terms of what you think is important to say about these four years as Governor? Anything else we should just put on the tape for the record?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, I think one thing that I would add, and again, I’ve alluded to this at the very beginning when we were talking about the great support that Lowell received from the public when he first announced that he was going to run for Governor. I think you have to look at the time as a time like this, as well. </p>
          <p>People had a general sense that things were not going well in the state, that it was overspending, that there were going to be large deficits, although nobody knew quite how much, and that a change was really needed, but what I got from answering those telephone calls which he didn’t answer was they were supporting him because they really felt he could do this. They needed a strong individual to be Governor and Lowell had that reputation, and there were people who had not necessarily supported him in the Senate who were calling saying, “This is the time for somebody with guts.” They encouraged him to take this job on, so it was this real—and he likened it to the Obama situation, but I likened it to the fact that people really wanted someone who was very well disciplined and a known quantity, and he was known for being—[phone rings] People knew what they were getting. They just didn’t like the solution.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. But there was a long career that built up to these years as Governor.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And saying he was going to make those—yes, I mean—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And he was going to make the tough decisions. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I actually think that people knew what kind of Governor they wanted and they got the Governor that they wanted. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But in retrospect, there was no alternative, was there? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Nobody likes to pay taxes, but an awful lot of people who today even complain about the income tax actually got probably a tax break. Anyone on a fixed income certainly got a tax break. Anyone who, the seniors who were being taxed on capital gains—  I don’t think people realized basically you were talking about 4 percent income tax. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We see it today. People want services, but they don’t want to pay for them.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You got it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So, I mean— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>That’s what it comes down to. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You got it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>She’s given us the right conclusion here? Is there anything—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, as I said, I’m definitely going to talk to D’Amore and Balducci, and you’re definitely going to do that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I will do that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You definitely want to talk to Tom D’Amore, no question about that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, I know. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>The other thing, Phyllis, if you go to Hartford, you certainly should drop in on the archives at the State Library. Don’t forget—they did the gubernatorial period. That was their job, and even now, we sent up a whole box full of material that somehow escaped and came down here.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>All those materials are processed and catalogued?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, yes, they have a very good index.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It’s all done. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. Well, thank you very much. This was a terrific interview. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>So where do we go tomorrow? The state constitution or education specifically brought in as a state right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s the only constitution?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I better get that book out. [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well it’s right there. Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Where the state constitution literally says education is a right of the state.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s just implied in all the other states?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>You’ll have to find it here, but the Constitution of the State of Connecticut is in here. Article 8 of education—“There shall always be free public elementary and secondary schools in the state. The General Assembly shall implement this principle by appropriate legislation. The state shall maintain a system of higher education, including the University of Connecticut, which shall be dedicated to excellence in higher education. The General Assembly shall determine size, number of terms, and method of appointment of the governing boards. The charter of Yale College as modified by agreement with the corporation thereof in pursuance of an act of the General Assembly is hereby confirmed. The fund called The School Fund shall remain a perpetual fund, the interest of which shall be enviably appropriated to the support and encouragement of the public schools throughout the state and for the equal benefit of all the people thereof. The value and amount of said fund shall be ascertained in such manner as the General Assembly may prescribe, published and recorded in the Controller’s Office, and no law shall ever be made authorizing such fund to be diverted to any other use than the encouragement and support of public schools among the several school societies as justice and equity shall require.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you don’t think other state constitutions also lay out this responsibility?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I’ve heard they don’t. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Check it out. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, we’d have to check it out. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>We’ll check it out. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. Well, thank you, and I will see you tomorrow. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>We’ll see you tomorrow. Looking forward to it. </p>
