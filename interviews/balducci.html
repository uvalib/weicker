          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is Phyllis Leffler. It is March 17, 2011. I am in Hartford, Connecticut, at the Doyle Group in the offices of Doyle, D’Amore &amp; Balducci, and today I’m speaking with Richard J. Balducci, who was speaker of the house of Connecticut during the years when Lowell Weicker was Governor, so thank you for being here and doing this today. I appreciate it. </p>
          <p>Could you start out by telling us just a little bit about your own personal background, both in terms of the evolution of your career up to the time that you ended up in the Connecticut house and then became speaker? If you could just give us a short biography here.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000102"></a>0:01:02</p>
          <p class="c-header">Balducci serves in Connecticut House of Representatives</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Great. I think I can do that. I was born and bred in the state of Connecticut, one of four boys, and I lived in the town of Newington primarily most of my life. I went to Central Connecticut State University and graduated with a degree in political science and education. I taught school for eight or nine years and then went into private business. In 1973 I was asked to run for the town committee in Newington. I checked with my wife and she said, “Go ahead. Try it if doesn’t take a great deal of time,” and I did. Then in 1974 they needed a candidate for the house of representatives to challenge some Republican who had been there for about 12 years and had won overwhelmingly. </p>
          <p>I checked again with my wife who said, “You know, if you run and win, the sky’s the limit. You don’t know what it could mean for you. If you run and lose, at least you know. But in ten years to look back and say, ‘What if’ would be sad.” So I chose to run and I was fortunate enough to win. I won in the Ella Grasso landslide of ’74 after the [Richard] Nixon administration problems, etc., and was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives where I served 18 years. The last four of those years I served as speaker of the house, and the last two years I served in the state senate. I also became a candidate for Governor in 1994 in which I did not get the nomination for the Democratic Party but was close. </p>
          <p>In the legislature I began as chairman of the energy committee and labor committee. I served there. I was an assistant majority leader for many years. I then served as deputy majority leader in the house, and in 1988 I chose to run for the speaker’s office. It was a rather unique situation in which I chose to run at that time using primarily Republican votes to get elected to the speaker of the house position over an incumbent speaker who was trying to run for a third term, and that was unprecedented. It was always two terms as speaker. I ran against— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Excuse me just a minute. When you say you ran for that office, are you running within—I’m not quite sure how the speaker of the house is— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>The speaker of the house is elected by the entire house chamber, members of both the Democratic and Republican parties. The majority caucus at the time was the Democrats.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. So you were running within the— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>So I was running within— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>—there unofficially. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In the legislature. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>It’s a long story, but at any rate, I was elected. All members—Democrats and Republicans—select a speaker. The majority leaders are selected by caucus, but the entire chamber selects the speaker. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I see. I see. Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Every man and woman in the chamber has a vote, and I garnered all the Republican votes and enough Democratic votes to win the speaker’s job in ’89. Probably not the best time to have been elected speaker, since at that time, as we all know, the economy was on the slide and the state of Connecticut was in the midst of major economic difficulties. </p>
          <p>Governor William A. O’Neill, a Democrat, was Governor at the time, and a good friend who was always advocating no income tax, as I had for many years, all the time I had been a state representative. We did things—I’m sure some of the others may have told you, such as William Cibes, who was my finance chairman—that were very difficult to do with increasing taxes on business and on the local community. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000515"></a>0:05:15</p>
          <p class="c-header">The issue of establishing an income tax in Connecticut</p>
          <p>In 1990, Lowell Weicker was elected as the first Independent Governor of the state of Connecticut in a three-way race. It’s ironic that during that election cycle, for me moving into my second term as speaker, I chose not to take the oath against the income tax, recognizing that we had to put everything on the table because of the economy.<br>
          </p>
          <p>He, in his address to the members of the house and senate, advocated an income tax at that time, which all of a sudden made headlines across not only our state, but I think across the nation. I was still not in favor of an income tax. I wanted to look at other possibilities. Having sat down with people such as Bill Cibes, who was chairman of finance, etc., and Richard Mulready, who would follow Bill as chairman of finance two years later—he was there following Bill Cibes’ first two years as chairman of finance. </p>
          <p>But back to the issue. I did not want to do an income tax if it was at all possible. So trying to avoid the income tax at all costs, but now the Governor had come out advocating an income tax, so I had to deal with that, not only within myself, but within my caucus also, the Democratic caucus. There were probably more than half of the members who were advocates of an income tax, and the other 30 or so members—there were 87 or 88 members of my caucus. About 50 or so advocated an income tax. The rest were against one, so I had to deal with that within the caucus itself.</p>
          <p>Lowell Weicker, I’m sure it’s been said before, first of all has a very deep-sounding voice. He is a man of stature, an imposing figure just from his presence. One of the things that I’d come to learn about the Governor was that he is very bright, very capable, and when he takes a stand, it’s very difficult to change him if he believes he is correct. He was looking for support. Of course, he was a man of no party at this time. The Republican Party in the state of Connecticut had a real disdain for him. The senate president, John Larson, was absolutely opposed to an income tax and came out and stated that. I still held to the position I would look at it, but was certainly not in favor of one at that point. </p>
          <p>As the month of February approached, the latter part, I recognized the fact that there was no way out of this mess that we’ve gotten into, this dilemma of economics and the fact that we were spending more money than we were bringing in. Many of the ways that we’d resolved problems in the past had been, to use a term, “smoke and mirrors” or “one-shot monies,” which means you have money for this year from wherever you’re getting it, but next year those funds are not available, and that’s how we had balanced the budget the previous two or three years. What he was advocating was to impose an income tax, to impose certain freezes on hiring, etc., etc., and decreasing the sales tax, which for the poorer people in the state, an 8 percent sales tax he had thought about moving down to like 6 percent, which is a 25 percent decrease on the average man and woman out there. </p>
          <p>I finally sat with a couple of my people. I’d sat with Bill Cibes. I’d sat with Richard. I had sat with others and looked at all the potential possibilities, and we were looking at a 12 percent sales tax, increasing the base of the sales tax to like another 20 or 30 items, including baby food and diapers and prescriptions, and it just didn’t make sense to me. I’m basically a fiscal conservative, but on social issues I’m pretty much a bit more to the left on it. But the fiscal issue right now is the one at hand that I had a concern about most of all, and recognizing where we were and what had to be done, I chose to support an income tax. [phone rings, interrupts] I don’t remember where I was—recognizing we had to do something with the income tax. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And going over the numbers, you were saying, with Bill Cibes and becoming convinced in looking at the implications for the poorer elements of the community.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>During that time I had also been meeting with the senate president to find out where he was going to be. I had conversations with Tom D’Amore. I had known Tom previously when he was state chairman of the Republican Party, but it was very casual. As I got to know him more and more, our relationship grew not only from respect from a political standpoint, but on a personal level also. Governor Weicker I always felt was Governor, not from my political party, but I came to know him also quite well, and after a time, it also became personal, you know. He became a friend. I came to really enjoy the man, but he always one of those people for whom it was “my way or the highway,” so to speak.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He can be very persuasive. [laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Yes, he was. But if he felt he was wrong, which I also found out, or felt that he could be corrected, he would be willing to listen to that and make some minor adjustments to wherever it was. The point being that I spoke with those gentlemen who were promoting, of course, the income tax, and looking for allies, and of course in the position he was in as an Independent Governor it was very difficult for him to find allies, certainly not in the Republican Party, but amongst the Democrats, too. He did gain allies from the more liberal side of the Democratic Party who were very pro-income tax and wanted to see that happen and liked his policy of lowering a sales tax, etc., but didn’t have me yet. But when I held that press conference and came out in favor of the income tax, I pretty much solidified at least our political relationship as to the direction we were going, because we were now on the same page.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Can I just ask— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Sure.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—what the political implications of that decision were for you in terms of your own constituents? Was that a difficult thing for you to do to come out?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>It was, because I’d always been against an income tax, and the ironic part about that is in my first election against the Republican I ran against way back in ’74, I used the income tax issue which he had voted for in 1971 against him, and it’s almost ironic that 20 years later I am now an advocate of the income tax.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, times change and needs change. I don’t know if that’s really ironic.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>You’re right, but it’s just the idea—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>It’s almost 20 years exactly that that occurred. I also had a concern about the constituents I represented, because I never wanted to tell them an untruth, but I did advocate that I was not going to be against an income tax this next term around, so I felt conscience clear on that. But still, I had a large group of working people and middle class people in the town I represented, so I felt that I had to be cautious as to how I proceeded with this. When push came to shove, the bottom line was this was the only way to get us out of the doldrums of economic defeat, so we more or less— </p>
          <p>Plus the fact that he was not a Democratic Governor. He was an Independent Governor, and as most people saw him, still a Republican Governor to some extent. But it seemed like he was willing to lead. He was a strong leader and very sure of himself, and his proposal was not unreasonable. It needed to be massaged and changed, which he recognized, and we did over the course of time massage and change that income tax proposal in many, many different ways, but the basic thrust of it was I had now aligned myself with Lowell Weicker, which meant now I had to get 76 votes to get this bill out of the house. </p>
          <p>The senate side, of course, was being pushed by other people who advocated an income tax and were trying to garner—they needed 18 votes and then they would have the lieutenant governor, as you’ve probably already been told, Eunice Groark, to support it and make it 19 to 18, and they were seeking those votes.</p>
          <p>Well, my concern was 76 votes out of the house. It was a long and arduous task. Even today as I walk into a room in the legislative office building, the room number’s 2C, and it’s 20 years later, I still get a chill up my spine walking into that room and thinking of the hours and hours that we spent in caucus. I literally mean two and three times a week, four, six, eight or ten hours in caucus taking time only for lunch breaks or dinner breaks and coming back in and that was it.</p>
          <p>And what I tried to do, the way I operated, was to try and get folks to express their opinions, both the pros and the cons on the income tax. I had a big board, which I still have, with all the issues on it that were pro income tax, the anti-income tax issues, and had people give of themselves, express their ideas. I found that if you expressed your ideas to everybody else and we took all of it, part of it, or none of it, you at least felt satisfied as a legislator that you had an opportunity to speak and make your point and listen to the counterpoints on it, and we did that day in and day out.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So these were sort of reflections line by line on the proposed budget and what could stay and what might go?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Right. Absolutely. Absolutely line by line as to what we wanted and what we didn’t want, and it progressed, by the way. First, it was just the income tax and what could be done and the strong advocates in opposition to it, and then it was, okay, we make some moves here. I’m still against it, but it would be better if we ended up, let’s say, having a biannual budget. We ended up having a biannual budget. If we ended up garnering support for some of the people down-state who felt if we eliminated the dividends capital gains and interest tax, which was I think 13 or 14 percent, made that 7 percent as it was for earned income, etc., all these things were massaged and talked about during the course of time.</p>
          <p>And during that period of time, and our legislature ended in June, we voted on what they called three budgets that were coalition budgets. They were the standard non-income tax type. All three passed. All three got vetoed by the man on the second floor, and at one point he threatened to shut the state down, shut down parks, etc., laid off, I think, two thousand state employees, but I’m sure Bill would have been more direct on that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We didn’t actually get into those details, but those are on the record. We can find those.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Right. Threatened shutting more down and doing more layoffs so that we can pay our bills.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So what’s happening then in the legislature while he’s vetoing these budgets? Is there a lot of anger, consternation, frustration?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>There’s a lot of anger. I think the Republicans were very angry over it. A portion of the Democrats were very angry over the idea of implementing an income tax, and my solution to that was let’s talk about it, let’s everybody get together, and that was to get into groups. The Governor would talk to people individually to try and convince them that this was the way to go and why it was the way to go. To just say, “Vote for this, it’s good” doesn’t make sense. You have to lay it out for those people who are from a poor economic background to those people who are very wealthy why it could be advantageous to you, and he did that. </p>
          <p>And Tom spent—as a matter of fact, I thought D’Amore was going to have a heart attack during the process trying to get folks to coalesce and come over to our side, and we did pick up people. We did pick up votes, but on the other side you had constituent groups that were out there campaigning and marching on almost a daily basis outside the capitol in opposition to the income tax. You also had the pro-income tax people there. The good news was that business came to our side, recognizing it was important for business, that lowering the corporate taxes and the surcharge corporate tax that we put on would be beneficial to them.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And the media, too, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>The media was also. Yes. I was going to mention those other two things. Those folks. The unions, the state employees, came on the side, advocated for an income tax, and the press also did many articles, editorials, and front-page articles advocating for it and the reason why it was the better way to go at that point, so we continued working that thing out. </p>
          <p>I can remember meeting July 4th at the supreme court building. My wife said, “When you come home, you may need a lawyer because we end up divorced because of this issue.” I spent all of 4th of July, instead of with my family, at the supreme court building with a combination of Democrats, Republicans, and leadership of the house and senate and the Governor’s leadership folks there discussing the other potentials. One of the things we consider was the VAT tax, the value added tax, which the state of Washington has, but it didn’t work for us because they set that up basically for Boeing, as I recall.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Which we need on a national level.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Well, but that’s where it was and it wouldn’t work for us anyway, so we walked away still scratching our heads and looking for solutions. But out of that all came the idea of modification in some ways, aside from the income tax, but doing other things like setting up the rainy day fund and meeting a certain percentage. You can’t raise spending above the CPI [consumer price index] or a combination of two, whichever was the lower. We set up the biannual budget that was implemented, a group to look at a five-year forecast down the road to make projections to how things would go and the method of our spending, so there were a host of things that were put into this tax package that were not tax driven. In other words, it had nothing to do with the income tax itself, but helped to modify costs and expenses during that period and moving forward.</p>

          <p class="c-header">Governor Weicker’s role in advocating income tax</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You’ve given me a very good description, I think, of what was going on from your end in the legislature. What can you say about what the relationships were like between the executive and legislative branch of government during this time? Obviously, you are working closely with Tom D’Amore and the Governor’s office in terms of making this happen. From your recollections, do you remember people—there must’ve been some people in the legislature who were feeling very hostile to what the executive branch was proposing. Do you remember anything about that in particular?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Even before I advocated for the income tax, the Governor’s office was always—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Suspect, or—?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>No. For me, they weren’t suspect. They were always straightforward and basically honest, which I feel as a politician doesn’t matter whether you’re a man or woman, black or white, rich or poor, Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Just give your word. Give it straight.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Your word is all you have to give, and I used to tell that to my caucus—don’t ever lie, because your word is the only thing of value up here. Everybody’s an equal and his word to me was always good. Now, they complained about the time that he used the term “an income tax would be like throwing gasoline on a fire,” but I believe that was taken out of context, and if you go back and look at the entire structure of that speech that he gave, you’d understand exactly what he was saying. He advocated for it because he thought it was the right thing to do, even though he didn’t want one, so I respect him for that. </p>
          <p>His office worked I thought basically with the Democrats, because trying to convince—I do know that Tom tried and the Governor himself tried to slip over and talk to Republicans also who were willing to listen, but it was more difficult because they were still feeling burned from the fact that he’d deserted the Republican Party for his Connecticut Party. There was always dialogue, probably more than any other time, and I served under three Governors. You always saw him and his staff walking around the corridors working the legislature in both the house and the senate.</p>

          <p class="c-header">Passage of the income tax</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In his book, he talks about two different votes at the final hour before the budget was passed in the house I think seven hours apart after the senate approved and then the house—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>—rejected it at six o’clock in the morning.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Rejected it, and then seven hours later approved it. He tells a story that I didn’t quite understand, and I wondered if you had any other understanding of it, in which he talks about Dick Foley and some issue about meeting with him, being one of his strongest critics, and then went out and said he had cut a deal with the Governor, which seems to have then somehow affected people in the house. Have I got this right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Okay. First of all, we had been in session since the day before the income tax was passed. I think we went in session at ten o’clock on August 21. We were in session all day on the 21st and all night on the 21st. We were in session on the morning of the 22nd sitting around waiting for the senate to vote, which they did around 3:30 in the morning. We were at recess. I called the house back in, so we were in session for—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Nonstop.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>—like 36 straight hours. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Wow.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>A part of that gets a little bit hazy. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>I just remember where we were. The reason the senate took the bill up first, and you may have already been told this, was because we had previously passed an income tax bill, sent it to the senate, and they defeated it for other reasons. Everybody added something that they wanted upstairs and it lost, so what we decided to do this time was, look, let’s send this bill up to the senate first. If it passes, we’ll have an opportunity to vote on it downstairs. Well, in the process of it going to the senate first, they made a couple of amendments to it which members of my caucus who were pro income tax didn’t like, and so when it came downstairs after three o’clock in the morning and we debated it downstairs, it lost. I can’t remember the vote, but it was like 84—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It was like seven votes short, I think.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>It was at least seven votes short at that point. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>So I was under a little bit of duress.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It was 81 to 69. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Yes, okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It says it right there. So it was more than seven. Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Well, but if you think of the difference, you only have to swing 7 votes to get it to 76.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. That’s right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>So at that point I was a little bit drained, and I called Bob Frankel, who was my majority leader, after the vote came through and I said, “Bob, we can’t let them go home. We’ve got to get this done.” He agreed, and we both agreed that we should recess and caucus again, which we did. I called for a recess, indicated to the minority leader of the house that we were going to recess. Bob Jaekle, who’s a real class act and a real gentleman, said fine, so we called for a recess and we recessed and we recaucused. </p>
          <p>At that time, I tried to work on some of my members who had been there and more or less moved away. Tom D’Amore, who was probably as active on that floor as anybody working both Democrats and Republicans at that time. He had to do what he had do. I certainly couldn’t be talking to the Republican side for votes, but the Governor’s office could and did. </p>
          <p>We then reconvened when I thought we had picked up a vote or two from my caucus side and he had picked up a few votes on the Republican side. Now, there are several stories that float around of which I didn’t even want to be privy to as to how some of the votes came about, but when all was said and done, I believe it passed 75-73. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, that’s right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>—around 12:00 in the morning, and I have that vote sheet nailed up in my home somewhere. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>But it passed like 75-73, and shortly thereafter the Governor signed that bill into law. </p>
          <p>All the times that I had to deal with the Governor I think were interesting. He was always professional. He was always, in my opinion, forthright. I considered him thick as a rock sometimes, but he was always willing to listen, and to move him you really had to make sure that rock had a weak spot because otherwise he wasn’t moving. I always respected his intelligence and his ability to deal with people. He didn’t suffer fools lightly. </p>
          <p>I remember going to his house, and we did this on several occasions, but I remember pulling up to the residence and being stopped by a picket line. The state police had to come out to open the picket line because they knew who I was and they didn’t want to let me pass, and the language that we used and the signs and the things that went on were less than professional, but going into his house, and he was there just as happy as can be to see me and the other members that showed up to discuss possibilities of doing an income tax. We would spend hours and hours on it and he just dismissed those people who were marching up and down in front of his lawn, which made me a little bit crazy thinking that these people were doing it. He had no qualms about going on or walking outside. </p>
          <p>One of the amazing things that happened was the time after the income tax was passed and the implementation of it was about to take place in October. There was a gathering of about 40,000 people on the capitol lawn and they hung him in effigy outside the capitol lawn. Thank God I didn’t see myself there, but it was him that they had hung and he chose to walk out on the lawn and to talk to men and women out there who were in opposition to the income tax. Maybe today it could’ve changed, but I think he could’ve been really in danger doing what he did, and after what’s happened today— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>—down in Arizona and other places, you wonder. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He couldn’t do it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>But he walked out there as big and as bold as can be across that lawn, advocating his position and why he was for it and what it meant to the State of Connecticut, and the sad part is many of the men and women who were not going to even pay the income tax because of the $25,000 exemption were advocating in opposition to it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Because they didn’t know— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>They were beneficiaries of this income tax because by implementing it (a) they didn’t pay anything if they were making less than $25,000, and (b) they got a 25 percent bonus on a lowering of the sales tax from 8 percent to 6 percent. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>It always amazed me that many of those people didn’t understand what it was and how it worked. It was just that mob mentality, I guess, that took over. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They were not really informed of the issues.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003332"></a>0:33:32</p>
          <p class="c-header">Threats made to lawmakers regarding passage of income tax</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>No, exactly. As much as you tried, and even with the newspaper and the television and the radio, for the most part—there were advocates against it, but for the most part, advocating for it and why it was good and how it benefited the majority of the people of the state, you still had people that didn’t understand it. </p>
          <p>I remember the day it was to be implemented to go into law, October 1. I started getting phone calls at my home at six o’clock at night saying in six hours this is going to be implemented, and then some adjectives that weren’t worth repeating, and at seven o’clock, eight o’clock, nine o’clock, twelve o’clock, “You SOB [son of a bitch], we’re not going to be paying the state,” and then at one o’clock, two o’clock, three o’clock in the morning, just to disturb sleep, and I had young children at the time. We have five children, and God love my wife, she just was able to roll with the punches.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So did you feel personally intimidated through that period of time? I mean, Larry Bettencourt is on record saying that he wouldn’t run again because of the intimidation to his family. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>I don’t want you to—I don’t know if this is part of this, but I’ll tell you what happened, and I never repeated because of copycat things. I had my life threatened several times, but what really upset me and actually frightened me is to get a call—I’d be up at the legislature—from people—my wife would answer the phone at nine or ten o’clock at nigh—threatening to rape my daughters. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[gasps]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>On several occasions—my youngest daughter answered the phone once after school, and she was like ten. They knew where we lived. They said, “We’re going to take your dog and cut his guts out and hang him in your crabapple tree in the front lawn,” so they obviously had been by my house to know exactly—the only crabapple tree on the street. That kind of thing. </p>
          <p>I got every magazine imaginable sent to my house, from American Home to Zoology. I must’ve gotten 40 or 50 subscriptions. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>You just fill it out, send it to your home, and they’d send me the bill later on. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>My wife had gotten on two different occasions porcelain dolls sent to her. They were like a thousand dollars each, these dolls, with the bill saying, “Your first payment of $129.00 for the next 12 months, and here is your doll.” I’d gotten shoes, pants. What else did we get?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why would people send things? I don’t understand that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Well, can you imagine what you have to do to now— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Get rid of that. Absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>—get rid of those things. Thank God I had a wonderful staff.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it was just a harassment mechanism.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Absolutely, harassment. But to threaten my wife when she got a letter— and they couldn’t quite find, they tried to trace it but couldn’t—threatening her that they were going to beat and rape her because they knew where she taught school, but on at least four or five occasions threatening those kinds of things to my daughters.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Over what period of time was this?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Over probably three to four months.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Before the passage of the bill.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Before the passage, yes, and I got some after the passage of the income tax.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is amazing. So did you seek any kind of—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Well, I called the state police, and the only reason I called—my idea was if you didn’t like what I did or what the Governor did, vote us out of office. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Don’t take it out on my wife and children. They have nothing to do with what I have to do politically and philosophically in this case. My wife would even answer the phone, talk to people and try to reason with them, especially those people who were in the lower income brackets, and explain, “You’re not going to pay this. May I ask how much you’re making?” And they’d tell her and she’d go, “Well, you’re not going to pay any income tax because you’re not—”  “We don’t care. This is a bad thing,” and she said, “I finally gave up.” God love her that she would take the time to talk to these folks, but it didn’t work out well, and I never tell people this. I think I’ve told this story one other time and it was only recently. It’s been 20 years. I’ve never said it because I didn’t want anybody else to have to go through that thing. </p>
          <p>One of my members of the caucus had her door shot at and a bullet hole. The police came down to look and inspect and it was a bullet hole in her front door. She advocated supporting the income tax. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>My goodness.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>And other people got harassed I’m sure, but I think they were mostly after the Governor, of course, and me because I guess I was the leader really in the house and moved in that direction to do that kind of thing. I’m not sure that’s part of what you want.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, it’s certainly a part of creating the context for the times.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>I know the Governor himself may not want to admit it publicly, but I know he was harassed and threatened, etc., etc., over time.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. Of course his attitude about that was not to pay too much attention to that. That’s part of his basic personality.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>God love him for that. That’s exactly right. His personality said that’s the way it is.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. I think he earned his stripes early on over the Watergate issues.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Yes, he did. And you become thicker skinned, I guess, over the years. Since that time nothing really bothers me. I have a brother who fought in Vietnam and saw some very bad times over there and when he came back, he served as a vice president of a major corporation, etc., and he said, “What are they going to do to me? Kill me? What’s the worst they can do to me? Fire me? Let me go? I’ll do something else after doing that.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>And that same kind of thing I imagine the Governor felt having gone through the Watergate situation, that this is—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, he was a junior Republican, you know, and he was taking on the Republican establishment.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Taking on the President and establishment. Correct. Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that was pretty tough. Post-budget, post this crisis and the decision to go forward with an income tax, what would you say that the legislative/executive relations were like after that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>He only ended up doing two more years as Governor after that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, ’90— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>We passed it August 22 and change or whatever, noon, in 1991, so he had a couple of years left to serve, and I was then after serving my second term in the house—  ’90, ’91. My second term, he had two more years. The second part of his administration I served in the senate. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, okay. Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>So he’s elected in ’90. He was elected in—God, I’m losing it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, he was elected November 6, 1990. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>1990.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He’s sworn in January of 1991. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>’91.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And the budget is passed six months later. So right— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>’92. Right. I’m thinking of myself, not him. He had three years left to serve. I served out that term, ran again, and people thought I was going to lose. I ended up winning the senate seat for the last two years of that, ’93 and ’94, so I served in the senate there. To say that I think the Democrats for the most part, even those who advocated for the conventional way of doing business, were okay with him. There may have been a few who were really ornery or hostile, but I would think most of the Democrats had pretty good working relationships with him. On the Republican side it never went away.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Would that have been policy driven? In other words, are these Democrats supporting him because of the sorts of values and policies related to education and reform of social policy?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>I think so. I think it was due to issues that they needed help from the Governor because the buck stops at his office, and when you’re advocating for a new school or more money for education or could you help by doing whatever it might be in my particular town or district, in many cases you needed the Governor. The fight was fought. </p>
          <p>There was one move later on in December of ’91 to repeal the income tax. It failed by like 14 votes and that was pretty much the end of it. Everybody ran the following year on whatever issues there were. Many people who voted against the income tax voted as supporting the conventional method, and they were against the income tax and got re-elected, but I only can think of one person that lost an election that following year in ’92 because of the income tax. I truly believe the reason he lost was because he flip-flopped two or three different times on the issue, not because he came out for it or came out against it, because he flip-flopped, and he was from a really very difficult district. I don’t recall anybody else losing. </p>
          <p>I ran that second time for the senate, which broadened the scope from one town to five, and I won substantially the senate seat. I left the income tax alone wherever I could, advocated other issues, but when it was brought up, I defended it and the reason why. My opponent always brought it up when we were in debates and I would stand there and defend why we did what we did.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So once it was passed people just accepted it?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>I think it took time. The Governor who was elected in ’94, John Rowland, advocated repeal of it. Of course it never was repealed, and there were only half-hearted efforts to do it. I remember talking to him once and saying, “Governor, I’ll bet you say your prayers every night when you go to bed that we have an income tax implemented.” And he just looked at me and grinned because the dollars were coming in. We had lowered the sales tax, and corporations were doing better business in the state because they had lowered the corporate taxes. It did work out I think for the majority of the people in the state, and that’s who you have to worry about, the majority of the people of the state that you’re representing. </p>
          <p>When I was speaker, I always had to remember that I still represented my hometown of Newington, but as speaker, now I had to represent not only them, I had to look at what was best for the entire state because I was speaker of a chamber that had all 169 states [editor’s note: he said “states” but must have meant towns] represented, Democratic and Republican also. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="004504"></a>0:45:04</p>
          <p class="c-header">Governor Weicker’s strengths as leader</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So from where you sat and the kind of work you did, what would you say that Governor Weicker’s strengths were as a leader? Also I’d like you to speak to weaknesses, if you think there were any.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>As a leader, you knew that when he made a statement advocating whatever position it might be, whether it was that one or any other, the income tax or any other one, you knew that he could substantiate it and defend it and that he would not change his position unless clearly shown that it was wrong, so I always felt he was an outstanding leader. It made my job as speaker of the house better trying to garner votes in support of his position and then mine, that he wasn’t going to waffle on me and go elsewhere. </p>
          <p>You talk about drawing a line in the sand. When he drew it, it stayed, and I thought that was important because I didn’t worry about him all of a sudden two months later coming back and saying, “No, I think we can do this budget another way. We can do it the old conventional way, and yes, we’ll use smoke and mirrors, but we’ll get a budget out and everybody will be happy.” So he was strong. He was a very strong leader. </p>
          <p>I always recognized him as being not only strong as a leader but very bright and capable. He understood issues. He was willing to listen to both sides of an issue and then he’d take a position, and usually he stood by that position. I know that if I asked him or someone else asked him for something and he made a commitment, it was finished business. You didn’t have to go back and ask him again. He didn’t waffle. It was either yes or no, and you always knew where you stood with this man. I mean, it wasn’t like ho hum, well— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Was it ever, “I’ll think about it and get back to you”?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>On occasion he’d want more if he didn’t know or understand the issue. Many times when people would come to him, it may be a very local issue that he didn’t have a grasp. You can’t know everything in depth on all issues. He would do that, but once he understood it and once he took a stance on it, that was the end of it and you knew that if he made a commitment, it was done. </p>
          <p>I think he respected everybody. He respected all genders. He respected all religions. He respected all nationalities, which I think was important. He had a real warm spot for the handicapped. He was a major advocate of that in Washington and he became one here in the State of Connecticut, and they always had somebody that they could—if he had a real soft spot, I would say that was where it was, his advocacy for the handicapped and for children.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, he really initiated the legislation that led to the Americans With Disabilities Act in the Senate.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Absolutely. That’s correct. Of which John Doyle really understood better than anybody because he oversaw much of that for the then Senator. He was an imposing, formidable person when you first met him, and if you thought you were going to go in and going to get him to back down on an issue, because I saw it once or twice with people who were out to tell him a thing or two—wrong. Wrong. Wrong. I mean, he’d just sit there. He’d generally listen, to a point, and then if he or she was way off base, he’d just cut them off and end the conversation. See you later, thanks for coming by. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So those are all strengths.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Oh, absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Were there things that were really difficult, too?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>I think sometimes. As far as difficult, I’m not certain, but I think sometimes to the point where he may not have wanted to listen to an issue because he didn’t like it or advocate it I think may have been a minor weakness in him and he’d dismiss it, which sometimes may not have been the best thing to do. He listened to those people he respected and liked. To a degree, he listened to others, but not for long.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think you said earlier, or maybe Bill Cibes said it, that he didn’t suffer fools gladly.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>I said that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You said that. You said he respected everyone, but he clearly must’ve let it be known when he thought somebody hadn’t done their homework or was completely off base or was doing the wrong thing, and so in terms of the political interplay, that I would imagine could cause some—</p>

          <p class="c-header">The issue of gambling in Connecticut</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>It may have caused him to lose support on issues. I remember one issue in particular, he was against gambling in the State of Connecticut. I was against gambling in the State of Connecticut.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m glad you’ve brought that up. I talked to Bill about that a little bit, but I’d love to hear this from your perspective.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>You want my side of this?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>And there were senators who were very pro gambling. How do I say it?  The Indian tribes, Native Americans, had gone to court on the issue, had won in the lower court, had taken it to the supreme court, had won there, so that says we can go ahead and move this on our reservation and have gambling, and it was hung on the statute really that allowed bingos, etc., around churches. You know how churches and individual groups will have a bingo to raise funds, and it was all based on that issue. </p>
          <p>He then, meaning Governor Weicker, being against gambling, called for the repeal of that section of the statute. Even though I was against gambling, I didn’t support that, and this is one thing I think he may not have been happy with me about at the time, but I didn’t support it because it was like, “If you don’t play by my rules then I’m going to take my bat and ball and go home.” </p>
          <p>The tribes won at the local level, they won at the supreme court level, and now the only way to really beat them and prevent them from having it was to do it legislatively, which I did not like. I thought that they had won all the way through the court systems, why should they now be punished by taking away the law that allowed them and had allowed for years and years and years these other entities to go ahead and have gambling? So I was against him on this issue and I garnered support in the house on the Democratic side, which I needed. On the Republican side, I don’t think gambling was the total issue. It was more, <em>That’s Lowell Weicker, he wants this; we are going the other way.</em></p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs] Wow.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>And that I know to be fact, because I was told that because I had people who supported—I know people on the Republican side who were against gambling but were willing to vote against this because he wanted to prevent it from happening. I remember Tom D’Amore coming to me and asking me about it. I said, “No way. Let me tell you. I just believe that they have won all the way down the line. I’m not going to be the one that stands in the way of them moving forward, because the courts at both levels indicated that they had a right to do this.” So we did, and I don’t think he was overly excited with me at that point, but you know what? That’s the way it goes, and he certainly understood it, and we now have gambling in the state of Connecticut, which I don’t like.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But which has created a revenue stream, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>A large revenue stream, and everybody thinks that the monies from the lotto and from gambling are for education. They don’t realize that when the lotto was passed, the first $10 million was earmarked for education, and after that, the rest would go into the general fund, but it did create a large revenue stream for the State of Connecticut. You know, he did after the fact cut a deal with the Indians in which we get a fair amount, 25 percent I believe, of all the slot machine revenues that come into the State of Connecticut.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Bill Cibes talked about that. He said that that was sort of a brilliant maneuver in terms of making that pay dividends. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Cutting a deal, right, to the State of Connecticut.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>To the State of Connecticut, right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>But that was an issue where I clearly can state, and it was a major issue, too, so it’s easy, where I know Republicans voted against him just because he wanted that bill, and that was pre–income tax. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Were you involved in the issue at all of trying to bring the Patriots to Connecticut?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>No, I really wasn’t involved in that. I was in the senate at the time. That was John Rowland. That was after Weicker, I believe.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Bill Cibes, I think, thought it was during his term.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>Oh, yes, the first time around I think you’re right. I think of John Rowland, the Governor, and having been embarrassed by the fact that they end up pulling out. That’s right. I think he did. No, but I was not involved in the negotiations with the Patriots. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay, well, is there anything else that you want to maybe remember or happen to remember about those years as it related to Weicker’s governorship that you want to talk about?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>I think he’ll go down as—many times years later people recognize what a great coach somebody was, what a great President somebody was, what a great teacher somebody was after the fact, and I can think of a couple of teachers that I disliked when I was in high school, but I thank God that they made me do what I did, especially in the area of English, and I think he will look back, history will see him as a leader, somebody with vision that needed to know what had to be done at the time and that he will be recognized as somebody that put this state back in the black and not in the red. </p>
          <p>I know he’s upset, because every so often I’ll chat with him and he’ll talk about what’s going on now and seeing all the work that was done and much of it just being dismissed or circumvented, some of the things that we had put in place to protect spending in the state and yet make sure we provided for those that needed it, but I think he will be looked at as one of our outstanding Governors over time. My grandchildren will probably read about him as being one of those people. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you very much for taking the time to do this.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">R. Balducci: </span>For what it was worth, I’m glad we had the opportunity to chat. I don’t know if I gave you anything of value.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You certainly did. You really did. So thank you very much. </p>
