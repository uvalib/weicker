          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is Phyllis Leffler. The date is May 10, 2010. I’m at the home of Lowell Weicker for the third of our interviews in the Lowell Weicker Oral History series, and today we’ve agreed to just continue our discussion of Watergate and finish that up as best we can and then move on to some of the other important issues that you were concerned with while you were in the Congress. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000040"></a>0:00:40</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s interactions with Haldeman and Ehrlichman at Watergate hearings</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So on Watergate, we had just finished talking about [Harry Robbins “H.R.”] Haldeman’s testimony and the reaction of Haldeman to you, the very strong signals he was sending. I think you addressed in our last discussion your own reactions to that and your understanding of how livid and angry he was with you. Do you remember any other moments like that with particular individuals that seemed to you to be very significant passages in the hearings themselves? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. I think that both my dialogues with Haldeman and [John] Ehrlichman were rather spirited. I think as spirited was the dialogue with Ehrlichman where he admitted he’d hired somebody to spy on the personal habits of United States Senators, and thus also inferring that that was a practice that went on all the time in politics, and I remember getting pretty irate over the fact. I said, “Look, I’ve run X number of campaigns and I’ve had X number of campaigns run against me. I don’t recall either spying on my opponents or them spying on me.” I think Ehrlichman’s flip remark, he said, “Well, you must be an angel,” and I remember my response to him was, “I’m no angel.” No question in my own mind, I had plenty of faults along all the lines that he projected in the course of a lifetime, as do most people. </p>
          <p>I might add, one of the amusing things that came of that was a group of ladies in North Carolina went ahead and needlepointed a picture which sort of shows me as an angel and underneath it they said, “Yes, you is.” It had clippings from the transcript also as part of this montage. I think that is probably in the archives. If it’s not—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Actually, I’ve seen Kent. He has a picture of it posted on the wall.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s what came of that dialogue, so that was very spirited. Haldeman was of a different nature as he tried to go ahead and portray [Richard] Nixon’s political opponents. And by that, I don’t mean the opponents themselves, but rather the supporters of his opponents, as nut cakes and violent. He did that by the directives, both as to the violence he knew was coming with Nixon’s appearance somewhere in the South. Also Billy Graham, because he felt that really would be the icing on the cake as to how it would make these people appear, and he encouraged that. Well, I can tell you right now, for someone to incite violence in order to gain points for their candidate, I certainly had never heard of that in my life, and yet here it was being practiced in memoranda, in black and white, with instructions as to that happening. </p>
          <p>I felt that was probably one of the lowest moments of the Nixon administration because it wasn’t just some kid on the campaign trail. You’re talking about the Chief of Staff to the President of the United States, you’re talking about the President, and you’re talking about a highly revered man like Billy Graham. These people were encouraging violence against him. I think it was bad enough they encouraged violence against the President, but to do that against Mr. Graham I thought was outrageous, and that’s why I was as tough as I was on Haldeman. </p>
          <p>Haldeman was really I’d say an enigma in many ways. Number one, he lived in my backdoor and I never heard of him. He lived in Cos Cob, Connecticut, and in all my political life in Greenwich, which Cos Cob is part of, I had never heard of Bob Haldeman. In any event, as you know, he became Chief of Staff. He was the gatekeeper. Ehrlichman, I guess I can only gather he came from the West Coast, and maybe Haldeman originally came from there, but Haldeman actually lived, as I say, right next door to where we were and I never heard of him, and, quite frankly, I never heard of him in Washington until he became known as the Chief of Staff to Nixon. </p>
          <p>I understand the job of Chief of Staff is a very tough one. You are the gatekeeper, but I look upon that as being the gatekeeper in terms of governmental policies and people. I don’t look upon it as being as a gatekeeper for the political antics of the President, and he certainly was that, as was Erlichman. They worked as a team. </p>
          <p>So that’s why early on, as you well know, in the proceedings where I got upbraided by both Sam Ervin and Howard Baker, I suggested that even though I had no proof at that time, because this was very early in the proceedings, enough bad things had happened that I thought the Chief of Staff ought to resign. That was turned on me by Baker and Ervin, who thought I was too big for my britches—I probably was—for intimating that Haldeman knew of illegal activities. </p>
          <p>I had no evidence of that early on. I did later on, but not early on. I merely said that a Chief of Staff certainly owes it to his boss to keep to a dull roar or keep to a minimum the number of unfortunate acts that are taking place within the White House. On that basis alone, I think if Haldeman had been working for me, I certainly would’ve canned him or he should’ve had the grace to relieve himself. That was the basis of it. Not anything illegal. By the time you get to these documents that we’re talking about here and also other events that transpired during Watergate, it was very clear. He was very much in on all the stuff that was either nasty, illegal, gross, or all three.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000925"></a>0:09:25</p>
          <p class="c-header">President Nixon and the IRS</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>As part of the Watergate investigation—maybe it was not part of Watergate, but I think it was—you decide to explore President Nixon’s tax records from ’68 to ’72. Can you explain why that would be related to—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, that actually came, I think, after the Senate had closed its hearings. It was on information received from John Dean and also subsequently by Pete Kinsey, who was on my staff, and without getting into all the details, what it had to do with basically was his donation of his papers—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. To the National Archives.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>—to the Archives. And the taking of a tax deduction [laughter]. What it really boiled down to was Richard Nixon paying, I think, anywhere between $500 and $800 worth of federal taxes year after year. Well, for a man that used the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] to go ahead and embarrass his opponents, I don’t think there was anything more embarrassing than the revelation that these donations, which were illegal and for which he had claimed a deduction, ended up, for all intents and purposes, with him paying no taxes at all. </p>
          <p>I mean, look. We all had problems with the IRS. I’ve had them. I’ve paid late, but boy, I had to pay a whopping fine and I paid a whopping amount of taxes. I wouldn’t fault him if he had been late on his taxes, or he could pay penalties on his taxes. That happens to everybody, but to pay no taxes—and you’re the President—on the basis of an illegal gift, wow, I think that’s wild. I really do. As I recall, it was either the <span class="work-title">Providence Journal</span> or the <span class="work-title">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</span> that got the story on that. I can’t remember which. One of those two newspapers I think we worked with in getting them the story.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you say in your book, <span class="work-title">Maverick</span>, that you feel that that was essentially the nail in his political coffin.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>He already had a public that was pretty fed up. Maybe the public really wasn’t aware of the Constitution of the United States and the powers of the various players in the Constitution, but boy, I’ll tell you, one thing the public knows about is income taxes, and if they couldn’t somehow translate the betrayal of his oath of office to the Constitution, they sure as hell could understand him not paying taxes.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001224"></a>0:12:24</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s handling of campaign contributions</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know you were cleared of all these charges, but there were people in the Nixon administration who also made claims against you, right? For false reports of improper campaigning.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Sure. Absolutely. They claimed—you’ve got to understand the federal law as it was written at the time, and the federal law in campaign donations has been changed so many times it doesn’t even bear any resemblance to what it was, but basically you could not take cash, and by “you,” I mean the candidate himself or herself, from anybody. Nixon had his right-hand man, Jack Gleason, offer a campaign contribution to me, which was a contribution made both to the campaign and to me personally in terms of cash. The only problem was I never got the cash. </p>
          <p>I was busy campaigning upstate, and so my chairman, Phil Drake, was the one that received the cash. Phil went ahead and duly put it into the campaign bank account, and because it was Connecticut, it was reported. In other words, Connecticut’s laws were stronger than the federal law, so not only did I not get it, but what was gotten was reported. </p>
          <p>Now, I knew all this, and so when they started to throw this bullshit around, and they did from day one. When I went and had my secret meeting with John Dean, he mentioned this. A reporter for the <span class="work-title">Washington Star</span> tried to make a story out of it in the middle of the hearings. Other reporters asked the question, but I knew we had done nothing wrong. </p>
          <p>I figure I’m not going to put up with this anymore. “Why don’t you just throw it in the hands of the special prosecutor, put it in the hands of the law enforcement. Let them investigate whether anything was wrong.” I think it was actually after the hearings had concluded in a time after that that they did issue a report that, lo and behold, nothing wrong was done, but I figured that was the only way to handle it. I could sit there and protest until I was blue in the face. Probably nobody would believe me, any more than they’d believe any other politician. Let law enforcement handle it. Law enforcement handled it, and the conclusion was exactly as I had said it was.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you feel like there was a direct connection between that and your role in Watergate? Did you feel like this contribution was purposefully manipulated in any way?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No, no, because the contribution was given before I was even elected to the Senate.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. It went back to 1970.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It was back to 1970, right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But the revealing of this, the claiming of it, came out much later.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Sure. It came out, as I say, during the Watergate. And I might add, of course, to me the great story of all that isn’t so much me, because the contribution was given, the contribution was reported, the contribution was declared legal, so the only part of that story is the attempted blackmail. Call it anything you want to, but the real story is when Jack Gleason called me and told me that he was delivering these envelopes addressed to various United States Senators in which envelopes was the detail of the contributions made to their campaigns or to them personally by him, Jack Gleason. He ran what is known as the townhouse operation. He operated out of a townhouse, either in D.C. or Alexandria. I can’t remember which. In any event, the whole purpose of that was to tie the candidate or the Senator or the House member to the administration. </p>
          <p>Anyway, Jack called and he said, “Look.” Because I’d called Jack earlier when I learned about this and I said, “Jack, if I’m not mistaken, I never saw you with the contribution.”  He said, “Well, you didn’t, because I never gave you one.” So we established some sort of a personal rapport by that conversation. He called me and he said, “I am now delivering these envelopes addressed to various United States Senators and Representatives to George [H.W.] Bush, who was head of the RNC [Republican National Committee], and then I’m going to let him do what he wants to with it.” Which I suppose is perfectly proper protocol for Jack rather than go Senator by Senator. </p>
          <p>I got a call from Bush. I didn’t trust him anyway, so I made damn sure—I didn’t have a speakerphone and I certainly didn’t have recording devices. But he called me and he said he’d received these documents and then he asked the question, “What should I do? Should I burn them?” </p>
          <p>My response was, “For God’s sakes, George.” I could call him George because I knew him when he was in the House. He had one term in the House before he got beaten for the Senate. I said, “For God’s sakes, the Republican Party is not involved in this mess. The Committee to Re-elect the President is, and that’s not the RNC. You do that and it comes out, and all of a sudden you have managed to put the whole Republican Party into this pit called Watergate.” So he thanked me and hung up. </p>
          <p>Now, I knew, I could just tell from the resonances, or whatever you want call it. I knew I was being taped. There was no question about that, absolutely no question about that in my mind at all. They would’ve loved to have me say on tape, “No, burn them.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you think that was a setup? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh sure I do. Oh yes. I can’t prove that, but do I think it was? Absolutely. Why would he turn to me and ask me for my advice as to what he should do with these 50-some odd envelopes with money in them? I can understand him calling me and saying, “I’ve got an envelope here for you, what do you want me to do with it?” No, no. It was the generic, the whole thing. I know I was being set up, and my answer that I gave was the answer I’d give, setup or not setup. It was true. It was really true. </p>
          <p>I think one of the motivations, remember, that I have stated many times in the past is I felt not at all anti-Republican or anti-Nixon. I felt that the best help I could give the party was to do the best job so that people wouldn’t look upon it as Democrats doing their thing and Republicans doing theirs, that indeed whatever result was arrived at was arrived at by virtue of hard work on all sides, and I felt very keenly that my doing a good job was in a way protecting the Republican Party, since I was a Republican, so the same reasoning that I applied to myself got me in an uproar when Bush suggested as the Republican National Chairman you ought to burn these documents. We’d already been through burnings with Pat Gray and all the rest of it. I didn’t need any more of that stuff, and certainly not at my party headquarters. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002158"></a>0:21:58</p>
          <p class="c-header">The risk involved in accusing the President of the United States</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It sounds like one has to be awfully aware, constantly, about the efforts to undercut—especially, I suspect, once you’ve been found to—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Once I got into the middle of this thing, I literally had to walk on eggshells. Again, I could check with Bill Shure, but I’m sure his name was [William] Dobrivir. It’s a strange name, but I’ve remembered it. He made some tax accusation or something on Nixon during the Watergate, which has proven false. He was made mincemeat of by Nixon’s people in the White House. That’s why I knew that anything that I said or did had to have merit. Otherwise, they’d make mincemeat of me. </p>
          <p>The White House is an enormously powerful organization with all of its various arms of public relations and news and all that, and the President himself. My God, I mean you cross that and believe me, you’re going to get blown out of the park. So yes, whatever I said, whatever I wrote, whatever I did, believe me, was done very, very carefully to assure that I wasn’t going to enjoy the same fate as Mr. Dobrivir. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Lots of landmines, it sounds like.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, yes, tremendous. I might, just out of curiosity—I’m going do something here. I know Bill Shure would be able to pick this one up for me. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are you going to check out this guy’s name? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, I just want to see what— </p>
          <p>[Interruption for phone call] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I don’t remember— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>He’s not in my book. No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I don’t remember coming across that name. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. All right. Bill Shure will know. Because boy, they really blew him right through the roof. I vetted everything and I made sure my staff vetted everything, because we knew early on that the Republicans on the Committee weren’t pleased with me, and the Democrats, and that included especially Sam Dash, didn’t want a Republican to get any credit for any work they were doing. </p>
          <p>Now, fortunately for me, I had a very good relationship with the Democratic researchers or investigators, as did my staff. Terry Lenzner, who I’ve maintained a friendship with, Scott Armstrong, and there was one more, but I’ve maintained a very good relationship with them, so we got along perfectly well. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that’s what you mean when you say you vetted everything, that you needed to sort of work it through the Committee and the staffers? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, to make sure that I wasn’t going to get caught off base.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So, last time we talked, we did talk about the implications of Watergate for your own career, and how early on this put you in a very, very public place and essentially in the spotlight. Do you have anything further that you want to say about the implications of your early involvement in Watergate for the record?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I was pretty miserable at the outset. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In what way?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, young freshman Senators did not attack Presidents of the United States, and certainly having just been elected from Connecticut, Republicans didn’t expect that kind of performance by me. Indeed, oh my God, I named her National Committeewoman. Martin Ransohoff was her son. He’s a Hollywood producer. Babette Ransohoff lived in Stamford. I had named her the National Committeewoman. She never forgave me for my performance on Watergate, and we were close friends. We were really close friends. She was a good gal, and yet she could never reconcile herself to the fact that Nixon was what he was, and I was responsible for his downfall. And that of all the people that I knew in Watergate, I would say was the one person I lost and never, never got back. It was too bad, because I truly liked her. She was a nice person.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This has to have other implications.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>But to go from that point—at the beginning, believe me, more often than not, people flipped me the bird in the state of Connecticut. They didn’t believe me. They believed Nixon. And you can’t blame them. I don’t blame them. Now, admittedly, as it was all over and drawing to its conclusion, I was the state hero, in some people’s minds, a national hero, but that wasn’t the case when it started off. So that was the two-edged sword. Anything where you take that much of a gamble, you’re either going to be a dead man or you’re going to be a hero. </p>
          <p>And because I did move slowly and went step by step, I never doubted the ground that I was on. I would not have hesitated. If I’d come across witnesses or incidents that were exculpatory in the case of Nixon, I’d have said so. I would not have hesitated, because I wasn’t after Richard Nixon. I was certainly after the kind of behavior that I thought he was involved with, and I’ve said many times, as you know, my conclusions, my separate views, were all written before the tapes came out. Before. And when the tapes came out, I don’t think we were wrong in anything, and I don’t think there was much of anything that I hadn’t already said. There’s where I was exonerated by an impartial jury in terms of what those tapes revealed, but it only gives you an idea as to how careful we had to be as we moved through this morass.</p>

          <p class="c-header">Weicker reflects on how taking unpopular stands affected his career</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you bucked your own party in essence and certainly took on the President, who was a member of your own party. Do you see that as having ramifications throughout the rest of your career?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I think it does. It certainly didn’t at the time. Republicans had to sort of regroup after the Nixon debacle. Certainly I backed [Gerald] Jerry Ford, and I liked Jerry Ford. My credentials with the Republicans were pretty good. I think the problem with my career was I’d say that first of all, there was Richard Nixon, and then I had to deal with Ronald Reagan. </p>
          <p>There’s nothing dishonest about Ronald Reagan except for the fact that he has an agenda that is way off from what I thought the agenda should be. All you have to do is see Reagan’s comments about me that have been released with his diaries to understand that I wasn’t exactly the most popular kid on the block in the White House. The same holds true of the conservative Republicans throughout Connecticut, especially due to the fact that the state chairman, a man by the name of Frederick Biebel, was angling for a job in Washington and was trying to link the Republican Party of the state of Connecticut with the National Republican Party, which I felt would be a total disaster because Connecticut was such a dyed-in-the-wool Democratic blue-collar state. So the hate for Lowell Weicker certainly went not just to the experience of Richard Nixon but also with Ronald Reagan and everything he tried to do, and my bucking him. </p>
          <p>Add to that some of the social measures that I opposed—prayers in school, flag burning, court stripping, AIDS—all of these kinds of issues, and I had certainly a pretty hefty band of opponents out there waiting for me. In 1988 it all came to a head when William F. Buckley was able to sort of corral that whole group and suggest that they vote for Joe Lieberman, which they did, as witnessed the vote totals in the Gold Coast of Connecticut.</p>
          <p>So I would say that the Watergate and Nixon proved to be a huge boon. It certainly is responsible for the landslide election I had in 1976, and I think it also carried into 1982. But after ’82, I think that Republicans said, “Hey, what the hell is this guy?” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>A whole new set of issues after ’82?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, new issues and sort of the bad taste from before. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Let’s move on. Are you ready to do that? Is this a good time? Unless there are any final comments you want to make about Watergate?</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003748"></a>0:37:48</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s view of what America learned from Watergate</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I read the book, the comments in there. Well, yes, one comment I think that I do want to make. I wish I could say that Watergate taught the country a lesson, but it hasn’t. It was splashy news with lots of celebrities involved, but the basic issues which were at the core of the scandal, i.e., the Constitution of the United States, the power of the President, the rights that we all have as Americans, that’s all been forgotten. </p>
          <p>My God, all you have to do is take a look at the way the young George [W.] Bush acted as President of the United States. He makes Richard Nixon look like an altar boy. I would’ve been on the floor and nailed him a thousand times were I still in the Senate, but nobody’s going to do that, least of all the Democrats who should’ve, so the Watergate—it will be looked upon, I suppose, as a watershed when it comes to a President of the United States being held accountable. </p>
          <p>In the past, really nobody knew much about the President, and nobody was of a mind to hold a President accountable. To that extent, you live in a new age. People don’t mind holding a President accountable, and a President has to tread lightly if he’s going to go ahead and disobey the law.          </p>
          <p>But I was hoping more would come of it than that. I was hoping that we really would clean up our campaign financing. I was hoping that there would be laws in place that would make this kind of activity more difficult, but I don’t see any of that truly having happened, and I think you could have another Watergate tomorrow. Well, you did, in effect. You had Reagan’s fiasco and then all the stuff with Bush that has taken place. </p>
          <p>The American people have got to go ahead and maintain an active interest in their nation’s affairs, and it’s not enough to do it just when they get pissed off about some particular piece of legislation. They’ve got to be on the watch all the time. Maybe that’s too much to ask of everybody in a democracy, but I don’t think it’s too much to ask at least more than 50 percent to stay on duty, and that’s not even happening, so the Watergate to me was—I was vindicated as to that set of facts at that time, but do I think it’s had any lasting effect? No. And I think that’s too bad. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s discouraging and disappointing.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, it is. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And maybe that is really the opportunity to move into an area where you have invested a huge amount of energy and time and commitment. Another issue that’s very much in the news today is just the nature of the oceans and waterways in the country, because here we are looking at this massive oil spill and its effect on fisheries and the ocean and the ocean floors. It’s something you worked really tirelessly on to try to put into place a whole series of laws to try to improve—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I have more hope here, ironically, than I do on our knowledge of the Constitution. Just to go back to Watergate for a moment. I cannot remember who I was interrogating. I think he came from the military, somebody that was associated with some branch of the military and I asked him, “When you train your officers and your soldiers, do they have to take a course in the Constitution of the United States?” And I think he answered in the affirmative, but I want to tell you, Phyllis, I think a course in our Constitution should be mandatory at every level of education, K-12, college, obviously graduate schools. It just ought to be pounded home, and if that happened I’d feel vindicated on Watergate because people would be very alert to their rights. </p>
          <p>I mean the only damn rights you hear anybody advocate for now are gun rights. Jesus. I mean, thank you very much. I own my own shotguns, I go hunting, so I’m not some liberal nut, but do I think as a matter of common sense that there shouldn’t be any handguns in the United States. Damn right. Or any automatic weapons. You’re damn right. Long guns are an entirely different issue from concealed weapons and automatic weapons, and yet all I hear is people running around saying—I mean, can you imagine what they were advocating for in Washington, D.C.? Running around Washington, everybody should have a gun with them? This was this Tea Party stuff that just happened. My God, I mean—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But I’m not sure reading the Constitution would help on that matter.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I think, but that’s what they say—“We’ve got the right under the Constitution.” I’d like them to understand what other rights and responsibilities are in that Constitution, never mind just their bloody guns. I know it’s very simple and seems benign, but it would be devastating. </p>
          <p>If you took a poll on should there be prayers in school, I have no doubt 90 percent of people would say, “Yes, sure.” Well, doesn’t anybody understand that the separation of church and state has created a haven for every religion known to man, and every religion thrives in the United States of America because of that separation? It’s these things that people ought to understand. They do if you sit down one-on-one, they understand, but they have to understand these things if the country is to survive and not just selectively pick out some little portion of the Constitution which I think has been totally misread and interpreted. But that’s my opinion. That isn’t a fact. Just to pick out a piece that they’re happy with—but it’s the whole document that works in this country, the whole document. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="004527"></a>0:45:27</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s interest in oceans</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>So in any event, to get to the oceans. Yes, after Watergate, I really wanted to get involved in something positive, and as chance would have it, I received an invitation from a foundation, Perry’s operation—what was the name? It wasn’t the Farber Ranch; that was the Johnson family. Bob will know—to go down and see an underwater habitat in the Bahamas. Up to that point, I’d never scuba dived. I had done a little bit of snorkeling. I knew nothing really about marine science or the oceans, but it certainly was intriguing, I thought, and I really felt like I wanted to get my mind on something else. </p>
          <p>I went down and I saw this thing, and the Senators and congressmen were told to stand on the bow of the boat and the water was clear and you could look down and you could see people and you could see this underwater habitat. I turned to the guy that was in charge of the project, a fellow named Bob Wicklund, and I said, “Mr. Wicklund, I’d like to see that operation firsthand.” He said, “Do you scuba dive?” I said, “No, but can I be taught?” He said, “Yes, but it’s going to take a day, and even that’s only a quickie course. You won’t be fully qualified.” I said, “Well, whatever it is, let’s get to work.” </p>
          <p>So I spent that day and the better part, I guess, of the next day in the swimming pool learning how to use my air tanks and take my tanks off and just the breathing apparatus in my mouth, all the basic stuff they still do for scuba diving. At the end of the 36 hours or whatever it was, out we went to the site. I went down and I saw the habitat and the people working in it. I saw the marine life in the area, and from that moment I was just hooked on the fact that this is the aspect of the planet that needs a lot more vision and a lot more care.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Would you say that was really your first engagement with that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Absolutely.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Because Congress is quite involved in passing legislation from 1970 on. Congress passes in ’72 the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act. It’s also referred to as the Oceans Dumping Act. They passed the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>A lot of that I was involved with.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The Endangered Species Act.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I was involved with that, but it was after Watergate. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Because this is all happening while Watergate is going on, 1972, 1973. You go down to the hydrolab in 1975, so I’m just asking, really, in 1970, 1972, 1973, are these issues that concern you then? Not a whole lot?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Not a whole lot. I was aware of what was going on, but I can’t say that I was really involved.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So, it’s really your personal experience that triggers this understanding.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, there’s no question about that. Incidentally, I saw Bob Ballard on television last night or the night before in the Black Sea doing his work. [Weicker calls Bob Wicklund.] He’s invited me to join him on that. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>N.C.W.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Hey, how you doing? </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Hi, Lowell, how are you? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I’m doing fine. Listen, I owe you a thing for your book, don’t I? </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Yes, you said you were going to do it. Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>When do you need it? </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Well, they’re still working on it now. We’ve still got a little time. Probably in the next month. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Within the next couple of weeks? I’m listening here with Phyllis Leffler. She’s now doing my interviewing.</p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Is that right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. Now listen, tell me something, because I told Phyllis the story as to how I got interested in marine science and the oceans. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I told how you gave me a quickie course to see the hydrolab in the Bahamas. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>She’s telling me, however, that all these great legislations were being passed even before that. The Marine Mammal Act—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Some of them. Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>When did the Marine Mammal Act pass? </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>There were a lot of them passed in the early ’70s. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>October ’72 is what I have.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>She has October ’72. So, which ones did I engineer? </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Oh, a whole bunch of them. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Later. There were others. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Most of your legislation, I mean, things that you did, were through the Appropriations. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>You just got tons of money and new programs started by providing funds to NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], to the Marine Mammal Commission. You saved the Marine Mammal Commission several times from being cut out completely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Right. <br>
            </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>And that was all done through Appropriations, and then, of course, you supported a whole bunch of other programs that weren’t exactly your—you were a co-sponsor of them, but— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, but mainly through the Appropriations function. I know that’s the way we saved the NOAA research fleet. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>That’s right. You saved the whole NOAA research. You saved the Sea Grant Program. That was going under. The Marine Mammal Commission. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>All right, okay. I hear what you’re saying. In other words, I really worked the Appropriations end. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Yes. If you remember, I was so naïve when you switched over from the Commerce Committee to Appropriations. I was really upset. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, I know you were. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>You finally—  I saw the error of my ways. [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, well, it worked out. All right, Bob, I’ll be back in touch. We’re on oceans now, and that’s what we’re talking about. Also, while I’ve got you, which is just sort of separate from what I’m doing with Phyllis, is anybody pushing the marine programs under [Barack] Obama rather than letting weather get all the money? </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>You know, the marine programs have got a little bit of an increase, but I’ll tell you, it’s pretty grim. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Does he know he’s on tape?</p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>There are no heroes of the oceans like when you were there. There’s absolutely nobody. And Fritz Hollings. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yeah, Hollings. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>When you and Hollings left, that was pretty much the end of it. There’re a few people, but they’re not very active in terms of, environmentally, yes, but not specifically for the oceans. Pretty grim. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, we’ll have to work on that. Okay, well, you’ve answered the questions. Bob, I’ll get a paragraph for you. Incidentally, I saw a great show two nights ago on National Geographic of Bob Ballard and the Black Sea. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Oh yeah. I think I saw part of that as well. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That was interesting. I gather why it’s so great is there’s no oxygen in the Black Sea. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Yes, that’s right, and that stuff just lasts forever. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>All right. I’ll talk to you later. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Take care. </p>
          <p><span class="thirdparty">R. Wicklund: </span><span class="contactmethod"> [via telephone] </span>Bye.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Bye, Bob. So he’s saying that—you were going through the Appropriations— but again, this timeline that we’ve put together to look forward from that first dive, and I want to go back to that, the record shows that in 1977 you introduced the Whale Preservation Act to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. In 1978, you make a statement before a Committee on Commerce, Science, and Technology on aquaculture legislation, and then bills are later passed. So there’s a lot of stuff that goes on later in that way. There’s the American Tuna Protection Act, another bill, so there were bills that were introduced later, but I was just trying to establish your first interest, and clearly—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I gave you my first interest.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, it was triggered by—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That, and combining, as you heard with Bob, when you’re on that Appropriations Committee, that’s where you can really have the clout. It’s also true at this time that having established my bona fides, several things happened, which gave me the knowledge and the personal relationships to become the Senate expert in this field along with Fritz Hollings, who you just heard him mention. </p>
          <p>The Perry Foundation moved its headquarters to an island in the Bahamas, the Lee Stocking Island. Fairleigh Dickinson University established a major marine science school adjunct to Fairleigh Dickinson, New Jersey, on the island of St. Croix, and NOAA went ahead and located the hydrolab in the water off of St. Croix. I spent an enormous amount of time at the West Indies Laboratory, which was Fairleigh Dickinson University, learning from the teachers there about various aspects of marine science, doing a great deal of diving. I sang for my supper, in that I gave several classes to the students in politics and political science. </p>
          <p>I also engaged in several saturation dives at the hydrolab, in other words, staying down two, three, or four days at a time, and I visited Lee Stocking Island, which is Perry’s operation where he was making a bold attempt to—aquaculture was mainly his forté, but the reason I mention all these things is that it vastly increased my personal knowledge of the oceans. Then when I stood on the floor of the Senate or in Committee, I knew what the hell I was talking about firsthand. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="005925"></a>0:59:25</p>
          <p class="c-header">Concerns about funding oceans research</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I was always concerned, as I still am concerned, that NOAA money was going to find its way to weather more so than oceans, and unfortunately, I was right in that. The amount of money for marine science is just a pittance. It’s a disgrace. I cannot believe. Don’t forget, when I was a House member, I sat on the Space Committee and I was a big advocate for space. Well, buddy, I didn’t have to worry about the fact space was going to get its money. </p>
          <p>Only now—it’s really interesting—2010 to whenever it was when I was on the Space Committee, it would’ve been 1969—so, what, 40 years later? Forty years later people are questioning can we afford the vast sums of money we’re spending on space, and never, never, has anybody still raised how about a few million, never mind the billions, for understanding what covers 75 percent of the world’s surface. It’s unbelievable. Of all the things I wish I was still in Congress to do, that would be one of them. In other words, to make that a major effort of the United States, and of course it’s accentuated now that we’re doing all this drilling for oil, and Jesus, we don’t even know what to do when the shit hits the fan.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We sure don’t.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It’s something we should have intimate knowledge of, and if we had the kind of monies that they’d allocated to space, we’d be able to handle it. I don’t know what I’d do. That’s why I wanted to talk to Bob. I wanted an area that I want to really emphasize. I suppose I want to sit down with the head of NOAA, that’s probably where I want to start. But all I’m saying, I’m trying to just give you the grounding. I’ll let you take over in a minute. That was my grounding as to understanding what I was going to be legislating on, and you don’t think you can legislate on something when you listen to your staff member or you read in the book. You’ve got to understand what it’s like. </p>
          <p>I used to tell my friends on the Senate floor, and I meant it, and I say the same thing to people today. I used to be asked what’s it like down there on the ocean floor and I’d say, well, it’s everything the United States Senate is not. It’s quiet, it’s beautiful, and it’s logical and true, that’s what it is. So it’s time that we got to work on that aspect of the problem. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I wish I had some of that experience. I’ve never done it. I’ve never done even serious snorkeling, let alone scuba diving.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, you’d love it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well sure. It’s a little late. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Get out of here. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t snorkel. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Snorkel, right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I mean, make no mistake about it. You do the proper snorkeling and it’s as exciting, literally, as diving. I mean, Buck Island, which is off of St. Croix, is where you have that underwater park where snorkelers follow an actual trail, and there are markers that you see down there and it’s a big tourist attraction. If you ever come there, what I will do—you know how to snorkel?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>A little bit.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, it’s a start. There’s a reef that’s separate from this national trail and you start at one end of it. You’re literally in three feet of water. You can stand, three or four feet of water, and you let the current take you right down this reef. You will see everything in that reef that other people will see at much deeper depths for longer periods of time. It’s just magnificent, absolutely magnificent, so don’t think you have to be a diver to understand corals and fish and all the rest of it. You can see them in three or four feet of water.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Let me ask you a few specific questions. NOAA is established in 1970 under the Department of Commerce, but you clearly wanted it to be independent from the Department of Commerce.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, I wish it were. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Can you explain why?<br>
          </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="010422"></a>1:04:22</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker discusses two situations in which he was a hypocrite</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Because I think it was just a poor relative in Commerce. Nobody gave a shit. I know Mac Baldrige, who was the Secretary of Commerce, he didn’t care about it. He came from Connecticut, and when Reagan told him to cut it to pieces, he was perfectly willing to do it because he didn’t know it. And of course, that’s why I stepped in and stopped that. I mean, to me that was—I know I’ve committed many sins, but I have never been—I think, I think—a hypocrite. That’s one thing I don’t plead guilty to. I did it twice in my career. The first time I did it—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You were a hypocrite twice in your career?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. Because the State of Connecticut was about 35 percent Italian origin, I voted for Antonin Scalia for the Supreme Court, and I knew damn well I didn’t want to and I shouldn’t have, but I said, “Look, I’ve jerked everybody’s political chain in Connecticut. I’m not going to take 35 percent Italian Americans and also jerk theirs,” so I voted for him, but the point that I’m making here is it’s the second time that’s the worst. </p>
          <p>I think I’ve told you this story. Mac Baldrige wanted to go ahead, per instructions of Reagan, and decimate the budget of NOAA, eliminating certainly all their research ships. Now, Mac came from Connecticut. He came from Waterbury, Connecticut. He was the head of Scovill Manufacturing. He was a moderate Republican and a nifty guy. He was a close political ally and a close political friend, but it shows how your head can be turned when you’re asked to be the Secretary of a department by the President of the United States. He accepted, and down he goes to Washington, D.C., to be Secretary of Commerce under Ronald Reagan. Reagan orders these cuts as far as NOAA is concerned, so I go see Mac and I said, “Mac, please.” I’d already been there quite a while and I think he respected me. “Don’t do this. This is an enormously important endeavor and you ought to be out there really blowing the horn and trying to convince the President to do this and do it right and not cut it.” </p>
          <p>“No, Lowell, I’m sorry. I work for Ronald Reagan and he’s given me the orders and I’m following them.” I said, “Mac, I wouldn’t get into a pissing match with me either, because quite frankly, granted, I’m not the President, but as long as I sit on the Appropriations Committee and I handle the Commerce part of the budget, there certainly is a lot that I can do.” He says, “Well, you do whatever you want to do. I’m cutting the budget.” </p>
          <p>So I got ahold of Claudia [Weicker] and I told Claudia, “All right, how should we come at this?” I’m going to give Claudia part of the blame. And she suggested, and I agreed, what we ought to do is cut out all of his personal accounts—his driver, his secretary, all the things that serve him because those were all obviously in the budget, which I had to approve. He was notified that these all were being cut and he should notify his employees and give them the necessary notice that they were leaving. Well, sure enough, the phone rings. It’s Mac Baldrige. He says, “Lowell, what are you doing to me?” I said, “Mac, what are you doing to NOAA? I told you I wasn’t going to sit still for this.” He says, “Well, you can’t do this.” I said, “Well, you just find out whether I can. I can. And I am.”  Shortly thereafter, the research ships get put back in the budget and the cuts are minimal. </p>
          <p>Now, you say, “Lowell, why is this your most hypocritical moment?” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, exactly. It was my next question. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Shortly thereafter—Mac’s hobby was rodeo riding and he was in a rodeo out in Wyoming or Colorado. He was doing steer roping and somehow he goes off his horse. He’s wearing one of those big western belt buckle things and the belt buckle literally goes into his gut and kills him. Kills him. What a tragedy, because he loved doing it, he was happy doing that. He’d always done it, and in this freak accident he gets killed. </p>
          <p>About a month later, two months later at the most, I get a phone call from the head of NOAA. He said, “Lowell, we are launching the new NOAA research ship and we’re going to name it the Malcolm Baldrige, and the family would like it if you gave the dedication speech.” [laughter] I gave it, but I can tell you, Phyllis, as I said, it was the most hypocritical moment. Not that I didn’t like Mac, but a research vessel, when he tried to eliminate the whole fleet. It was dedicated to him? If it was dedicated to me, I’d be glad to give a speech. I deserved the Goddamned name on the vessel, not him, but it was the most hypocritical moment of my life. Anyway, I gave the speech.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, you did it out of some sort—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>His wife was lovely. He was a lovely guy. He just fell under the sway of Reagan’s people. In any event, it was a battle. The NOAA battle, the two battles, the real appropriations battles, were NOAA and NIH. Those were the ones whose budgets I had to go ahead and save.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="011106"></a>1:11:06</p>
          <p class="c-header">The challenge of NOAA being under the Commerce Department</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But in terms of a process and a sort of legislative and political process, there’s this issue of NOAA being under the Commerce Department. There’s also the relationship between NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency, and in both cases you really fought pretty hard, I think, for NOAA to have more funding and more independence.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Absolutely. I believe in that today.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you’ve explained how you feel about Commerce in terms of NOAA being a kind of stepchild.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It is.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But what about the Environmental Protection Agency? What do you see as the issues there?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Are they folded into Commerce also?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I don’t think so, but there was an issue of the relationship between—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Phyllis, I’d have to look at that up. I really don’t know. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. I mean, it was the role that the Environmental Protection Agency, I believe, was playing in the development of various kinds of environmental legislation, and I think you’re feeling that they were politically compromised in a variety of ways.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I’m sure they were.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And that NOAA had much more understanding of some of the environmental issues than the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] did, and so there was a kind of battle, I think, that went on between the two.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I’m going to have to get myself briefed on it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. You don’t remember those details?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I do not. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. Was working on environmental legislation different than working on other policies, or were the processes largely the same? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I’ve never considered myself, with the exception of the oceans, a major actor on the environmental stage. I really haven’t. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But issues related to the oceans, for example, are deeply located with issues related to business and to oil and to who controls fisheries and things of that sort. They’re all interrelated.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, but I don’t—to me, oceans issues have enormous environmental implications and environmental hope and promise and so on, but I admit I have not gone ahead and had a career based on those trees out there nor the National Parks over here or on emissions or coal. I just haven’t been in there. I’m not. Environmentally on the waters and the oceans, absolutely. That’s such a big chunk of the environment. You can’t be everything, and to me—I don’t think anybody knew more about the oceans and the water than I do, but that sort of came to the exclusion of knowing about these other things I’ve mentioned to you.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What do you see as the relationship between the work you did on the oceans, for example, and offshore oil drilling? Aren’t those two completely related?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, absolutely.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you took a stand on offshore oil drilling at some point.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, but what I’m saying is if you don’t know the oceans, how are you going to attack on the problem of offshore drilling? What I find so amazing in this latest example that we’re dealing with is that people that are doing it, they don’t know what they’re doing, environmentally. Well, I might try this thing. Well, this thing didn’t work. Now we’re going to throw garbage at it. I don’t know what that’s supposed to go ahead and do. I’ve read that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It is shocking. They don’t know what to do.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>They don’t know what to do. My God, with all the time and money we have, you can’t figure out ways—that if the shit hits the fan, it’s got to be obvious, you and I own that well. Always in the back of my mind is going to be the fact all of a sudden you can’t control something blasting through the earth. What’re you going to do? </p>
          <p>They’re used to having these major oil blowouts on land. Remember [Paul] “Red” Adair? Remember that name? He was the number one guy that could cap an oil well. That’s on land. Five thousand feet down, that’s different—if we didn’t have a knowledge of submersibles—</p>
          <p>[Conversation about contacting Bob Ballard, underwater expert. Weicker calls Ballard and leaves message.] </p>
          <p>For example, take Ballard, and even I with my knowledge of habitats and obviously carrying that forward to submersibles, either manned or drone, don’t tell me you can’t go ahead and do a hell of a lot down there even at 5,000 feet with those drones and submersibles. I’m not so sure we’ve yet developed a manned that can go 5,000. I’m not sure about that. But the point that I’m trying to make is we don’t know squat about the ocean floor. We don’t. All this does is illustrate the point I’m making to you. It’s not hard to do. If you ever had the money that NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] had, Jesus, you’d be walking down there right now with your tank and your gear on having a good time. So that to me is a shame. </p>
          <p>In the meantime, environmentally, to get to your subject, the coral reefs are getting nailed. They are in the worst shape around the world they’ve ever been in, and mind you, that’s like telling me that all the national forests have burned down here in the United States. The coral reefs are the forest for the ocean wildlife, and it’s getting just nailed. Obviously, water temperature has a great deal to do with it. Obviously, everybody is using the oceans as the bathroom for nation after nation and the garbage and the radioactive stuff and everything else that goes into it. It’s a disgrace. There’s so much work to be done environmentally I don’t even want to talk about anybody else’s environmental problem. If we had the money and the personnel, the oceans and the water are just huge in terms of the impact it has on all of us.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So what would be your recommendation right now for dealing with offshore oil drilling? Would you simply not allow it?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>If you don’t have the answer for the worst-case scenario, you don’t drill. You have an answer for it, fine. Be my guest. The platforms themselves don’t bother me. As a matter of fact, they make very good reefs for fish. That part of it’s true, but unless you have an answer for the worst-case scenario, you don’t drill, because the harm that then comes—oh, my God. I don’t know what they’re going to do on this thing. I really truly don’t. It’s really upsetting when you realize the implications for the people that live along that part of the United States, but just as importantly, that stuff is going to be drifting around out there in the ocean and landing God knows where.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, sure. I spent a week down in the Gulf region doing hurricane relief work a few years ago and my heart just goes out to the people who are going to be affected. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It’s huge.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They’re poor enough down there and they’re still coping with the aftermath of Katrina, and now they’re hit with this again. It is huge. One of the things you did sponsor when you were in Congress was his Superfund legislation to reimburse fishermen who were affected by offshore oil spills and people who worked with fisheries. Do you remember that one?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. I’d have to get Bob Wicklund to get briefed on that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you think that your work on oceans is one of the most important things you did while you were in Congress?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Absolutely. Yes, to me, Watergate aside, NIH, NOAA, disabled, and various civil rights issues. Within civil rights I include AIDS and apartheid and all the rest of the stuff.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who are the people that you remember as having been most important in your work, aside from Bob Wicklund, who I know was very central?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, Tim Keeney would also be very much involved with NOAA, and Tim is somebody that should be interviewed, because Tim went on with me to become Environmental Protection Commissioner in Connecticut. Then he, I think, went to Rhode Island and he ended up back at NOAA. I don’t know where Tim is right now, but he was very much bouncing around and is a very smart guy and a very good man who would remember many things. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are there other particular allies in elected office that you remember?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, Fritz Hollings without a question. I don’t remember who his staff people were, but Bob would. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Were there other staff people of your own who you think were important in that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>On oceans? Nobody could come close to Wicklund. He knew it all. He still does. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>An awful lot of stuff got sponsored during those years.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s what I’m trying to think. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s hard to remember these details, isn’t it, as I look back.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, especially, but in the oceans—don’t forget, Bob is writing his own book right now. I’m not worried about having somebody sit down and tell me what I did or didn’t do on oceans, because he’s it, and Tim Keeney. They’d be the two. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We’ve talked a little bit about your visit with Fidel Castro during those years.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, that encompasses part of your oceans, too. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, I know that. Do you remember having been very severely criticized at the time for having gone to meet with Castro?</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="012348"></a>1:23:48</p>
          <p class="c-header">Meeting with Fidel Castro in Cuba regarding oceans</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>The first trip was to encourage an exchange of visits between Cuban and American scientists underwater on the oceans. In exchange for being received in Cuba, I would do my best to have a team of Cuban scientists use the habitat off of St. Croix. First of all, I heard a lot of flak from a lot of people in St. Croix as to why Cubans were going to be allowed to use the habitat. And obviously I heard a lot of flak from people as to my trip to Cuba, but how are you going to tell a fish where Cuban waters end and American waters begin? It’s one big globe out there, and we all impact on each other, and that’s why I felt it was so important to that part of the oceans that the two biggest nations have their scientists get together. That turned out to be a very good visit in terms of the upshot. American scientists did visit Cuba, and Cuban scientists did visit the underwater habitat in the United States. </p>
          <p>I also had the opportunity on that first trip to dive with Castro, and probably the best part of the whole trip was to sit on the deck of the boat. I can’t remember whether this was the first or second trip, but in any event, whichever one, to sit and listen to the man because it took us about two or three hours to get back to where the boat was berthed. He literally, with all the maps in hand went over his entire campaign from eastern Cuba into Havana. It’s fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. </p>
          <p>At the end of that description, he says, “Now, I’ve talked too long,” which he usually did and is known for. He said, “I’ve talked too long. What can I do for you?” And I turned to him and I said, “Well, Mr. President, I would like to have the Major League Baseball franchise for Havana.” [laughter] As you know, talking about us being nutty in this country about baseball, believe me, it’s even worse over there. He said, “No, no, we keep that.” Smart man. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="012724"></a>1:27:24</p>
          <p class="c-header">Trip to Cuba to bring imprisoned American women home</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>The second trip was basically to secure the freedom of the American women that were held in jail in Cuba, all of whom were being held in jail on drug charges, and of course everybody in the United States says they didn’t do anything wrong, they just happened to wander near Cuba and get nailed on one thing or another. In any event, at least two of the women came from Connecticut, so I made arrangements, which took place after I left Cuba on the second trip. </p>
          <p>I went down there to talk to Castro about the problem, to ask for their release, but I didn’t get their release on that trip. He said, “If you make arrangements to send a plane, we’ll release them,” so I sent a plane with Kim Elliott, who’s the one that went down because she speaks fluent Spanish, and a friend of mine supplied the plane. We’d better get Kim sometime to explain to you. Out of the bunch who were standing on the tarmac there, and there might have been about seven or eight of them, at least three or four were OD’d [overdosed] right there on the tarmac, and so you’re talking—believe me, it had nothing to do with Cuban anti-Americanism. </p>
          <p>One of these days this country is going to act as tough on drugs as every other country in the world because every other country knows what drugs do to a world or to a country. In any event, there’s no question in my mind they’d properly been put into the slammer. But anyway, we got them all out and we got them home. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did those two visits have a serious and long-lasting effect on joint oceanic work?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think you’d have to talk to Bob. I think we had further communications, verbal, between the scientists and one thing or another. Boy, I’ll tell you one thing, I’ve love to go diving now down in Cuba. It’s probably the most pristine environment in which to dive compared to the ones that are over-dived, including the American Virgin Islands, so I’m sure that those communications helped.</p>
          <p>Just as importantly, I’m also one of those who feel the present policy is just nuts. I mean, when you think of all the money we spend to create this embargo and we’re the only nation in the world that has an embargo. Everybody else goes in and out of there. You want to win the war against Castro, send 10,000 American tourists over there and I think it’ll do the job. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How do you feel about the most current whaling legislation that’s just been—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I haven’t seen it. But, to me, I hope it’s as strict as it can possibly be because clearly those great mammals, they’re on their last leg if we don’t go ahead and protect them. They all ought to be protected. All of them. Screw the Japanese. They don’t need whale oil any more than we need whale oil. </p>
          <p>But in any event, I think the Cuban thing has just been dragged out unnecessarily because of our policies and I think that hopefully within this next decade it’ll end and we’ll play a more prominent role in the whole area scientifically. Cubans can get back to a normal life. </p>
          <p>For everybody that criticizes Castro, and I’m not in any way condoning the restrictions on human liberties that have existed during his regime. That said, when he took over the island, there was 95 percent illiteracy thanks to Mr. [Fulgencio] Batista, a dictatorship that he allowed there. The island is now 95 percent literate. It’s got one of the highest literacy rates in the world. Now, whether it’s “the gold-plated American system,” the fact is they have a good health care system over there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I was just going to say health care, too.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Which is a basic thing. Now, should you give up your liberty for health and education? No. I don’t want to do that, but at least understand what was done, and indeed, the Cuban revolution throughout South America and Central America is principally sending their doctors and educators throughout the area, and the United States doesn’t do that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Maybe these will be our last questions for today. I’m interested that you don’t see a clear relationship, as I guess I do, between a whole network of issues that you worked on, that is, water quality, industry as it relates to oil, hazardous wastes, the role of the—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You’re giving me too much credit for what I didn’t do. I know what I did do.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I don’t know. You took a stand.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>There might have been some stands individually, but I know the things that overwhelmed me, in other words, as to their—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And do you remember the—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You’ve already done one thing nobody could do. I’m rereading my book. I’m going over the notes, in other words, that you’ve left me. I’m doing everything I can to bring myself up to speed, and I’ll be seeing a lot of my staff.</p>

          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So what would you like to address on the 14th when we get together? What topic would you most like to talk about? We can talk about disabilities work. We can talk about larger issues of mental health and AIDS legislation. We can wrap all those together if you’d like to, but I’d like to figure out what we should focus on next time.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, we may want to talk about the NIH.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And AIDS?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>AIDS obviously falls in there. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. And what else falls in there from your perspective? I’d like to just go over some— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And disabilities. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Let’s focus on AIDS and disabilities, and I think you have some materials just focused on that itself. So I’ll go over that and try to be up to speed. I know you’re going to be busy, but at least—thank you very much.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Thank you for this. I’m looking forward to it. </p>
