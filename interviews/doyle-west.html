          <p>[Conversation begins with John Doyle discussing newsletters in archive as a good resource for Weicker’s work on disability issues]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>What I’m going to do is start off with some overview stuff that you either know or have heard of. Some of it happened before you got there, but you know of it. And then we can run through the first two years. I kind of segment it into the first two years of holding the line against the Huns, and then the next four of moving forward on disability rights and services culminating in the ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act].</p>
          <p>It’s a package that fits, and there’s a logic behind it, so that is what I’m going to try to do. Phyllis, you should know, Jane is not only my friend, as you can probably gather, but we were in a lot of foxholes together for a couple of years. [Michael] Hardman and [Michael] Morris were too. They’re not part of this conversation, but we were a pretty tightly knit little band. The fact that you’re talking to us 30 years later and we’re still talking to each other when all of us have gone on to greater or lesser things is probably testimony to that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Let me say hello to Jane.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Hi, Phyllis.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And thank you for joining us for this conversation.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> My pleasure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I just want to put on the tape for identification purposes that today is March 16 and we are in Hartford, Connecticut, in the offices of John Doyle, The Doyle Group. This is all part of the Lowell Weicker Oral History Project at the University of Virginia, and we have on the line Jane West, also a staff member and director of the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>On the Handicapped, at the time. That’s what it was called.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>On the Handicapped. Following John Doyle, so thank you both for being here today. I know John has some things you wanted to start out with, so why don’t I just turn it over to you right now, John.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000235"></a>0:02:35</p>
          <p class="c-header">Overview of Lowell Weicker’s years in Congress</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Thank you, Phyllis. I think it’s important as we start out to look at Lowell Weicker’s history in the Congress. He was, of course, a congressman from ’68 to ’71, and then he was elected to the United States Senate. From 1971 to 1981, he was in the minority, and that’s worth noting because minority members of either house of Congress have a whole lot less to do with what happens than the majority members. In fact, it’s my view that there was at least an even chance that had the Republicans not gained control in ’81, Weicker might not have run for re-election in ’82. He was very frustrated by being in the minority.</p>
          <p>From ’81 to ’87, Weicker was in the majority. Even though his term ended at the end of  ’88, he was back in the minority again for the last two years, so the part of his record that was the most productive, not surprisingly, was when he had the authority and the responsibility to do something. Now, it’s a credit to him that he took advantage of that, but that kind of causes us to focus on the years ’81 to ’87, I would suggest, as the richest times in terms of production for any of the things that he did. I’m going to speak to disability policy, but there were certainly many others that you’re aware of. </p>
          <p>Weicker came to become chairman of the Subcommittee on the Handicapped quite by accident. He already had had three committee assignments in the Senate, and Bob Stafford, the then Senator from Vermont, prevailed on him to join the Labor &amp; Human Resources Committee, the full committee, in order to give him, Stafford, and the Democrats a working majority. </p>
          <p>If one of the more conservative members had accepted this spot Weicker ultimately took, it would’ve tilted the balance to a tie that the then chairman Orrin Hatch could’ve manipulated, so it was Bob Stafford that talked Weicker into being a member of the Labor &amp; Human Resources Committee, his fourth committee assignment. Three were the rule, or typical; four was unusual. And then because of his seniority in the Senate, Weicker was given the Handicap Subcommittee. But both those things are a function of Bob Stafford having convinced him to do it.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in this dialogue I’ll talk a little bit about what that majority meant. Bob Stafford, Lowell Weicker, and the seven Democrats led by Ted Kennedy completely rewrote the rules of the Labor &amp; Human Resources Committee, frustrated the [Ronald] Reagan administration’s attempts to gut social policy, and yielded a pretty good result for disability, too. That’s getting ahead of the game, but it’s important to know that.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000522"></a>0:05:22</p>
          <p class="c-header">Funding for the Handicapped during Reagan years</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Let’s start by characterizing those years 1981 to 1987. The first two coincided with the first two years of the Reagan administration, and Reagan came up with a novel concept. He used the Budget Reconciliation Process, the process of Congress adopting a budget, okay? He used that process in an attempt to do two things: one, cut spending. Big surprise. You knew that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Two, he used it to repeal the categorical legislation in many human service programs. Of particular interest to us, let’s say, is special ed. The law began in the 1970s with the public law known as Public Law 94-142. All right. Reagan proposed repeal of that law. He called it a “block grant,” but that was just a nice way to describe repeal, and the 94-142 monies would go into this big pot, reduced 25 percent, and given to the states to spend any way they want. </p>
          <p>So as Weicker said more than a few times, it was sort of like the animals fighting for the crumbs that fell off the table at the state capitols. Weicker frustrated that and stopped it, but it’s important to understand that this term “block grant” means repeal of the undergirding categorical legislation, as it’s called. The business of using the Budget Reconciliation Process was both novel, and in many areas largely effective, but not in the disability area.</p>
          <p>I said those were the first two years. During that time, we had to make sure that we: one, established coalitions of disability organizations and advocates; and, two, held them together. I’ll have something to say about the latter. </p>
          <p>It was no time to disrupt the disability movement by introducing new concepts that might offend one or the other, nor was there much chance that anything like that would pass. Nineteen eighty-one and 1982 involved, on the Senator’s part, herculean efforts, in my view, that were successful, that avoided the cuts, made some modest increases actually in funding, but preserved the undergirding legislation, the three biggest for Weicker being special ed, vocational rehab, and the Developmental Disabilities Act.</p>
          <p>Nineteen eighty-three to ’87, but ’83 and ’84 in particular, another congressional process came along called “reauthorization.” The non-entitlement programs of the Congress go on forever unless somebody changes them. The others—let’s take one you’d be familiar with now—the Higher Education Act. Periodically, every three to four to five years, whatever, it comes up for what they called reauthorization, which means the law sunsets unless the Congress renews it, and typically that calls for a re-examination of the bill, how it can be improved, what should be done, how might the funding levels be adjusted, yadda yadda, anything that goes to the authorizing process of the Congress. </p>
          <p>In 1983 we had the opportunity to take a look at reauthorizing, renewing, extending, the special ed law, the aforementioned 94-142, now safe from the block grants. Reagan gave up on in ’83 the Vocational and Rehabilitation Act. Reagan also gave up on the block grant, and the Developmental Disabilities Program, a much smaller initiative, but one that dates back to the [John F.] Kennedy era actually in terms of addressing at the state level the needs of people particularly with what is now called intellectual disabilities and what was then called mental retardation. </p>
          <p>So we sort of coined a phrase that we were going to take a look at these laws not with the idea as they had been in the past of a professional being at the center of a circle, but from the client as being at the center of the circle, and we were going to array the professional services around the client as opposed to the other way around. This didn’t win us any friends. Jane, as I can remember, the Council for Exceptional Children, the state directors of special education or other folks, who were legitimate and valuable parts of that coalition I mentioned in the first two years, they all took it like good people, more or less. And there were a host of things that we did to put some flesh on the bones of that client-centered notion. </p>
          <p>For instance, we knew there was a disparity between the educational establishment and particularly the special ed establishment and K-12 administrators and parents, the most egregious being that oftentimes school systems would cap what are called related services, PT [physical therapy]/OT [occupational therapy]/speech and the like, for disabled kids and just tell the parents there was no more. Parents had little or no recourse largely because they didn’t know the bill, the law. I could tell you an anecdote, but for the moment I won’t, about how I was made aware of that very painfully in a very well-to-do, well educated, and economically very well off community in Connecticut.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> John, you should tell that anecdote. It’s a very good one. I use that to this day to talk about how one person can make a difference.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s true. Okay, thanks, Jane. I’m in Washington. I’m running this Handicap Staff Committee, Weicker’s in Washington. He gets invitations to speak. He’s chairman of the committee in jurisdiction from any number of disability organizations, rights groups, professional organizations, back in the state. Well, he can’t possibly attend all of them, or even all he’d like to, so what he’d do is send us out on missions. So I’d come back to the state and obviously I knew my way around and would go to these meetings. One occurred in early ’83 as I recall, because it was while we were working on the reauthorization of the discretionaries under EHA [Education for All Handicapped Children Act], as it was called then. It’s now called IDEA [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act], by the way, and it was a parents’ group in Fairfield, Connecticut. </p>
          <p>Now Fairfield, Connecticut, is an affluent town— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Absolutely. Still is. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>—and when I pulled in the parking lot there were more BMWs and Mercedes than any other kind of car. When I walked in, the men and women of the room—I hate to say this, but one hundred percent Caucasian—and nobody looked like they got their clothes at Goodwill. Their attitude and demeanor and everything else bespoke that. </p>
          <p>I gave a little talk on whatever was current then in disability policy, what we were working on, and then I asked for questions. And there were a few. Then this one person got up, I don’t remember man or woman, and said, “Look, we’re having an awful time here with max time,” and I said, “Max time. What’s max time?” “Oh, that’s in the law. Max time means that when our kid has so many units of physical therapy he doesn’t get any more because he’s gone over max time.” Jane was responsible for special ed, and I’m thinking Jane didn’t tell me about max time. Where the hell did that come from? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> [laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I never heard of it, and I’d been at this about two years by then, so I should’ve heard of it. As it turned out, there was no such thing. The school system had invented it and blamed it on Congress. Said, “Geez, we’d give you more, but Congress says that’s max time.” And these people, again, not undereducated, not economically disadvantaged, not any kind of people who you should feel sorry for, were absolutely bamboozled, and more importantly, the services that their kids deserved they weren’t getting. In the vernacular, they were getting screwed.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>So when I got back and Jane convinced me it wasn’t something that she hadn’t seen, what we did is we created a new category to create parent training centers in each of the states on the law to tell them exactly what their rights and responsibilities were, and we took the money, Jane, as I recall, from Part D.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> That’s right, from the universities.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s right. [laughs] Part D was Pupil Personnel Development. Okay? That was the money that went to universities, not only universities, but the universities primarily, to train to do both in-service and pre-service special ed training, and they all liked that. Of course they were the people that were training the folks how to bullshit the parents, so we figured that was pretty equitable that we took the money from their share. Now, we didn’t zero the program, Jane. What did we take? Ten percent or something like that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> It started out as a set-aside. Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>What is it now? Free standing, do you know?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, yes. It’s free standing and it’s about $35 million, John. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, geez. [laughs] That’s more than all Part D was at the time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Anyway, what’s the point of all that? A nice story, and I got a trip back to Connecticut. Well, I mean first of all, they were BSed [bullshitted]. The woman or man who was talking to me completely confused me and I’d been on the job for two years running the show. We were rewriting the law and it just brought to bear how badly this professional-centered universe, as well-intentioned as it might’ve been, and the fact that many of these laws wouldn’t be there were it not for the professionals in the field advancing the causes, had somehow grown over the years or evolved over the years into something that served the professionals more than it served the clients, which was too bad, you know. So we set about— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who came up with the idea of this client-centered program?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>We did. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>“We” meaning? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, the people that are on this phone and Hartman and Morris, and we told Weicker about it and he liked it. Is that about right, Jane? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. I would say that, John. It was his idea is what I would say, and everybody else was, “Yes, that’s good.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Well, I don’t know about that. Weicker’s—and this is worth saying, too. Lowell was like a lot of politicians. He respects professionals and has professionals around him, but in the office, there was a real dark line between those people that had also been with him in the trenches politically in Connecticut, some cases, like in mine, before he was elected to the Senate, and those that just came along for the ride some years later. The former group got more authority delegated to them than any other staff member of the Senate. </p>
          <p>I had more authority in the areas where I was responsible than virtually any of my colleagues. I could vote proxies. I could put bills together. Why? Because I’d been part of the political generation that supported Lowell. In a word, he trusted me. He knew I had his interests at heart, and the important things he needed to know about he would, and the stuff he didn’t, well, he might not hear about it, but he could trust that they were being dealt with. I think to be fair to Jane, since she threw me a nice compliment, I think he had quite a confidence after a time in the professional staff we organized. These were pretty bright people with some pretty deep experience in many ways, much, much deeper than mine. I had some limited experience, but not as much.</p>
          <p>Okay, so what are these things? Parent training centers in all the states, early childhood demonstrations, Jane, which I suspect was yours.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>School-to-work transition programs. The two major laws I mentioned—special ed and vocational rehab—think of them on a chronological continuum. Special ed, K through 18 or 21. Voc rehab, 21 and up. Special ed started in 1973, ’74. Voc rehab started in 1920 as actually a rehab program for the World War I vets.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>—and evolved into something else. These people didn’t talk to one another. So you’re a special ed student, okay? You go through all of the bureaucracy and whatnot and somehow survive your K-12 experience. You go to rehab. You start out fresh. No papers follow you. Nobody knew. There was no integration, no nothing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Seriously? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>We tried to do several things to integrate the rehab and the special ed programs, post-secondary programs for all disabled. I think it’d been previously limited to either the blind or deaf. Do you remember, Jane? It was one.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I thought it was both. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Okay, maybe that was it. We said, okay, for post-secondary programs we’re looking at all disabilities. There were two very important discretionary grant programs in the rehab act that Reagan kept trying to do away with specifically in addition to the whole act itself. One was the independent living center movement, which you may be familiar with around the country. They served principally physically disabled folks. He wanted to zero them out. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>The other was a Projects with Industries program, which actually linked persons with disabilities, and this was before supported employment with employers, real employers, not job coaches, but actually the place where you go to get a paycheck. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Reagan did everything he could to zero them out. And we did everything we could to keep them alive, and we did. National Council on the Handicapped. That had been an advisory body within the Department of Education. </p>
          <p>Back in 1981, I had my first visit to the Senate floor, and it was an interesting time. Jesse Helms had come to Weicker and told him that his wife was active with a particular institution serving a particular disability and that, really, he, Jesse, could use some money. Lowell didn’t know what it was about and so he had me come to the floor. </p>
          <p>Helms explained it and essentially what he wanted to do is take money, about $10 to $15 million, out of the state special ed grant and give it to this particular organization serving a particular disability. I explained to him that I’d be happy to recommend to the Senator and I’m sure he’d go along, that we add the $10 or $12 million to the organization, but we weren’t taking it out of the state grant. We weren’t going to cannibalize one disability for another, and Helms showed what an offensive, boorish, holier-than-thou buffoon he was. I had never met anybody in my life—and, boy, I’ve met some offensive people—who was such, in the vernacular, an asshole. I mean, he was a—</p>
          <p>Now, these were three men talking on the floor of the Senate. The Senate wasn’t in session. There was no crowd. Nobody was— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>This wasn’t a play, a show— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>—with an arch over you. What we wound up doing is we put the money into this particular organization, did not take it out of the special ed grant, but I tell you that story, one, because I remember it, but two, it’s sort of illustrative to a greater or lesser extent. All the individual disability groups were interested in the individual disability group. </p>
          <p>Jane could tell you if she wanted to about a day when two wonderful advocates of two different disability groups got into a pushing match in our office over a provision that one thought favored the other over his interest. So in Washington in those days it was very difficult, it was impossible, to get any kind of broad-based think tank public policy suggestions because anybody you would talk to had an ax to grind. They were for this disability. They were MR [mentally retarded]. They were the deaf or the blind or they were the special ed or the voc rehab people or, I don’t know, just keep going. Millions of them. </p>

          <p class="c-header">National Council on the Handicapped</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>So we thought it might be a good idea to establish a think tank within the federal government to develop broad-based disability policy, okay? That’s as succinct as I can make it. So what we did was we took a moribund advisory committee buried in the bowels of the Department of Education, yanked it out of the Rehab Act, made it an independent federal agency called the National Council on the Handicapped, presidential appointment, Senate confirmation, and gave it broad-based authority and necessary funding to be the think tank on disability policy. It began its operations in 1984. Within a year and a half, Phyllis, it produced a report called “Toward Independence.” That was the ADA. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh really? Really, that was the— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And, John, I don’t know—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And Jane’s done a whole book on it, or paper, haven’t you, Jane? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Well, I’ve done a lot of work. Yes, I’ve done two books, actually, on the ADA, but it might be interesting to know. The organization still exists. It’s called the National Council on Disability now. They changed the name. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> So here we are almost 30 years later. It has a very robust presence in Washington. As a matter of fact, John, I was just asked to contact Senator Weicker to see if he would come and speak at a hearing they’re holding about the current budget and its impact on people with disability.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, no kidding. Well, offline, Jane, I’ll give you his number. He’s down in St. Croix, so if it’s anywhere near—he won’t be back until I don’t know. May, I think, or late April.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh. Okay, I emailed Claudia. That’s what I’ve done in the past, but if there’s a better way to reach him, let me know.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, I’ll get you the number before I leave here. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I don’t know how interested you are, Phyllis, in a follow-up to where are these various programs now 30 years later, but there are some really powerful stories in there. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I would in general be interested, but I think for the record in terms of understanding the role that the staffers played, which is what this project is about right now, I think we probably should just stay focused at the moment on that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Okay, very good. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Although if we have time at the end, maybe we could come back to that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>All right. I told you Senator Weicker delegated to the people he trusted, which weren’t terribly many, an enormous amount of authority, and that included me because of my political background in Connecticut in the past. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We’re going to get into that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>But that said, each of these major initiatives we brought to him. I mean, we’re not going to put something in the bill with his name on it without telling him we’re doing this stuff. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. Of course. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>So all of these things, and there’s one more I’m going to mention, but all of these things he agreed with. Whichever staff person, like the early childhood, and Jane, I don’t remember you doing it, but I’m sure you did— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I’d say, “Okay, Jane, explain to the chairman,” and she’d give him a little background and so forth and so on. The only one that he hit the ceiling on was the National Council on the Handicapped.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Ah, that’s right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And he said, “Goddamn advisory committee. We have too many advisory committees. I’m not going for it.” That’s about verbatim. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That sounds just like him. [laughs]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, yes. So it took us five times before I finally wore him down to let me put the National Council on the Handicapped in as an independent federal agency, and he wasn’t convinced. He just got worn down, and in a moment of weakness, let me do it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What was your thinking about why that was so?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>My thinking was this. First of all, there was no honest broker I could find that didn’t have an ax to grind and wasn’t teed off at some other disability. I mean they were really fractured. There’s still some of that left, but you’d want to see it at the time. You couldn’t get an honest answer. You couldn’t get people focusing on broader disability policies beyond whatever the hell funding stream influenced them. So it was the retarded or the blind or the deaf, whoever, that’s all they cared about. Or learning disabled, that’s another big group, it was all they cared about, LD kids, and you had to somehow get beyond that and get something of—forgive me for using the term—an institutionalized presence for policy development in the disability field in Washington.</p>
          <p>Since I didn’t have a lot of money to fund something like that, if I was one of the [Charles and David] Koch brothers, I’d just put the money up and that would be the end of it and have a Heritage Foundation II or something, but we didn’t have that, so what we did was create the National Council just for the purpose.</p>
          <p>Now, did any of us know that the National Council would come out with a major civil rights law for disability policy within a year or so of its founding? No. We didn’t know that. Did we put them up to it? No, we didn’t put them up to it. There had been discussions about a civil rights act for the disabled, but the prominent civil rights advocates of the time, Ralph Neas being one of them, took me aside and said, “It’s not your time yet.” Well, the National Council didn’t accept that, but so what’s the point? As Jane said, these several programs that I’m mentioning to you now that were begun under this client-centered initiative in 1983 have really produced some interesting results.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, sure. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002658"></a>0:26:58</p>
          <p class="c-header">Vocational Rehabilitation Reauthorization Act of 1984</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>The last one was mandating client-assistance programs in all states. This caused a hell of a war between the House and Senate conferees that I got myself in the middle of. Essentially what it said is much like the parents who were disenfranchised from services, too often disenfranchised from services their kids got under special ed, so too, adult disabled people were disenfranchised from having much say in what vocational rehabilitation, job training, and whatnot services they were given under the Vocational Rehabilitation Rehab Act. </p>
          <p>So in something analogous to the parent training centers, we seized on this client assistance program that represented the clients in an advocacy way before their Voc Rehab agents. If you didn’t like what Voc Rehab would do you had somebody on your side as opposed to your rehab counselor just saying that’s the way it is because they worked for VR. We mandated that in all the states. There was a huge war between House and Senate conferees and we won. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And what was that act called?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That was the Vocational Rehabilitation Reauthorization Act of 1984. It was signed in ’84. I can give you a cite if you want. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, I think I know what it is. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>The Rehab Act of ’84. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>You asked what does this client-centered mean. Where did it come from and what did it do? Those are the examples of where it came from and what it did and why we did it. And as I say, the Senator was on any given day, and now he’d go off on any of these with the exception of the National Council. Now, he will do that. [laughter] We weren’t right all the time, either. Jane, do you want to add to any of that? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> You know, there were a couple of initiatives I will add, John. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Go ahead. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I’m pretty sure I’ve got the timing right on this. When we did the reauthorization of the discretionary programs under the Education of the Handicapped Act, there were two—John’s identified here some of the areas where there was great need, like transition, in particular, and the parent training centers, but there was a group of students who were emotionally disturbed who were really not getting served very well by the larger state grants, so we carved out a new discretionary program to develop models for serving children who were emotionally disturbed, and that was one of the initiatives here. The other was— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That was in the special ed discretionaries reauthorization in ’83, Jane?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Okay, good. I didn’t— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> The other one we invested in was a longitudinal study that would follow students with disabilities who had been in special ed over time looking at what was their experience after high school. Did they have any further training? Were they able to get jobs? What was their life like? Did they have friends? Did they get married? You know, all of that stuff, and that longitudinal study went on for almost 20 years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Wow.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> It really has given us the only longitudinal database that we have that helps us look at outcomes, what happens after all this investment in students, so those were two of the areas. One of the great things at that time about the discretionary program is you could look around and see where are there unmet needs, where are there areas where we really need a greater investment to learn more, to provide more, and those were two of the additional areas in addition to what John mentioned there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Thank you, Jane. Let me go back a little bit. I’m not doing this chronology right, but the 1983 legislative work I would argue was critical. The 1981 and 1982 holding the fort work was critical. </p>
          <p>Let me tell you how it happened. I mentioned that Stafford and Weicker teamed up with Kennedy and the Democrats, and I’ll be perfectly blunt with you. Kennedy told his Democrats they supported whatever Weicker did in disability, and Weicker supported the Democrat majority as far he could in the things they wanted to preserve. Time worked up—the Reagan block grant proposals were stopped. The budget reconciliation process was stopped because the Labor Committee would not meet to adopt its part of the Budget Reconciliation bill. Why would they not meet? Because Hatch didn’t have the votes. He had seven votes out of nine. Weicker had the other nine. </p>
          <p>Well, this couldn’t go on forever, so we got word that Howard Baker, the then majority leader, a very fine Senator by the way, wanted a meeting of all parties in his office. Weicker was just coming back from a speech in the Midwest, didn’t know anything about this, so I drove out to the airport, picked him up, literally briefed him in the car, which I recall, Jane, was a Chevette at the time, so I stuffed him into that. It was a brown Chevette. [laughter] It was a lovely car. Drove over the 14th Street Bridge, back to the Senate, and he promptly went into a meeting. Let me tell you what he got. </p>
          <p>He got all the disability programs, and most, but not all, of what Kennedy wanted, continued his categorical programs, some with cuts, some like disability without—but as important, he got David Stockman’s promise and Howard Baker’s promise that this deal done to get the bill out of the Labor &amp; Human Resources Committee would stand through the Senate. In other words, the White House wouldn’t interfere with it and try—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s actually in his book.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s exactly right. That was a huge day. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That was just huge, and it was Weicker’s smarts, not Doyle’s, not any other staffer. Weicker said, “Wait a minute. I’m not letting these guys give me a deal to get out of Committee. I got the votes in Committee. What I’m going to do is make goddamn sure that I boilerplate this thing and get everybody—and Baker was a very fair man. Whatever you may have thought about his politics or whatever, the guy was straightforward. You got his word; it was good. And so when Stockman and the White House crowd signed on, Baker enforced it, and that’s why these laws were all saved.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But didn’t they renege at some point on the floor and then—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Well, they did on parts of it, but not on the disability stuff. But look at what was saved. You’ve got his block grants, his categorical programs, the Community Health and Mental Health Centers. They were gone. They were gone. Gone. Okay, the CAP [Community Action Partnership] agencies. I played in this a little bit, this arena, but my principal interest, as you can gather, was disability. Nominally, I was responsible to the Senator for all the other stuff that went on in Labor &amp; Human Resources, too. To be honest with you, I didn’t pay a lot of attention to it. Kennedy’s people did the health stuff. There was a wonderful young woman named Polly Gault—I don’t know what happened to her—who was my counterpart. She was Bob Stafford’s staff director in the Education Subcommittee, and Polly was wonderful. In addition to having a mouth like a trooper on a Friday night— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>She had a low tolerance for bullshit, a very low tolerance, and a wonderful woman to work with, just terrific. The last I knew of her she was off running the AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] Council, wasn’t she, Jane?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes, she was there, and then she was chief of staff for Admiral [James] Watkins when he became the Secretary of Energy. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And then she went on to do some lobbying for, I think, California Edison, an energy company, and she’s still around. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>If you ever see her, say hello. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes, I will. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Tell her all the lies I just told about her. They’re all true. They’re all true. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> [laughs] I’ll tell her to send you a check. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>In any case, that activity of Weicker’s having to do with the Budget Reconciliation Process in 1981 was key to virtually everything that followed in terms of not just disability but human services programs generally.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Can I ask an overarching question here? What was the relationship between the work that you did on disabilities and another major initiatives on institutionalization?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Okay, that was really under our aegis. Now, Steve Snider did it, and Appropriations gave it their blessing in the Labor HHS [Health and Human Services] Committee. Let me step back a half step further. In 1981 and 1982, Lowell Weicker wasn’t chairman of any full committee in the United States Senate except for Small Business. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s the only full committee he chaired. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003547"></a>0:35:47</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker becomes chairman of Appropriations Committee</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>In 1981 and ’82, he was a member of but not the chairman of the Appropriations Committee having to do with all these social programs, including disability. He was not the chairman. Jack Schmitt from New Mexico was. Schmitt was defeated in the ’82 elections. Weicker moved up as chairman in ’83. Claudia Weicker, Claudia Testa at the time, became his staff director. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But he was chairman of the Subcommittee on the Handicapped in ’81.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s right, so we had authorizing jurisdiction, but not appropriating. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Ah.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Now we were on the Appropriating Committee. He was senior man on the Appropriations Committee next to the chairman. We could beg the chairman, but the chairman was a conservative and he and his staff director, Gar Kanganovich, didn’t always agree with what we wanted to do. When Weicker took over as chairman, it gave them both ends on disability, both the funding authority and the authorizing authority, and by the way, that also went to a host of other programs, too, but you’re interested in disability. The investigations Jane could speak to better than I because I was off wandering around the National Council on the Handicapped.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, I was out there doing it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know that, actually. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I was responsible to the Senator for what happened. Snider did it as an investigator. Claudia blessed it for Appropriations. Jane, Steve Bongard, and I don’t know who the hell all else—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Terry Muilenburg—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Snider. Terry Muilenburg. Bobby Williams. Wasn’t Bobby part of it?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes, and Bob Williams.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Maureen Byrnes, too?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Maureen Byrnes. If Weicker went looking for something when something went wrong, as it did once when Bongard got caught out in Utah on television in Hatch’s own state and Hatch didn’t know he was there— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> [laughter] Ah, that’s right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I was the guy that got my tail roasted, okay? In no uncertain terms. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Tell me about that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>We had a meeting. This was a pretty irascible group, and especially when you got to Bongard, who self-described himself. He said, “Look, I’m like that. I’m just a Jew from the Bronx.” I said, “Bongard, I know a lot of Jews from the Bronx and you are—”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who is Bongard? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>He was assistant dean of the medical school here in Connecticut. We brought him down to handle all the NIH [National Institutes of Health] work on the Appropriations Subcommittee in ’83. He’s also a personal friend of mine. To say he could be a little thick would be an understatement. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>He’s since passed away, unfortunately, of a heart attack. He had a defective heart. Snider wasn’t much better, but on a different scale. I won’t characterize him. These were pretty independent people, so I remember calling him in and I said, “Look, you guys go out there. Don’t get yourself on television, and for God’s sake, if anything political comes up, I don’t care what you do in the institution, find out what’s going on, however bad the abuse is, they knew, there was no cover-up, nothing like that.” But I said, “Don’t pull any political stunts,” because I knew they were prone to doing it. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Investigating conditions in institutions for the mentally handicapped</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Well, damned if somehow the newspaper or television stations out in Salt Lake didn’t find out that Bongard was out there—I don’t know if Snider was with him—investigating a Utah state institution for institutionalized mentally retarded people, so they grabbed Bongard. Bongard gave an interview on television. Hatch’s sitting home one fine night looking at his television and there’s one of his own Committee staffers under the aegis of his Committee investigating an institution undercover in his own state and he doesn’t even know about it. [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But whose idea was it to do this investigation then, of these institutions?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>It was basically Weicker’s. It came out of—Jane, please help me with this. </p>

          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>We had Brad Reynolds up talking. He was the never-confirmed assistant attorney general for civil rights, so he never actually made it. He was acting or whatever, recess appointment or something. Reynolds was, just for what it’s worth, a DuPont heir, so he was clearly to the manor born. Weicker called him up and forced him to testify on what Justice was doing to enforce minimally humane conditions in these institutions.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> That was CRIPA, the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act. It’s still on the books.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>When did that happen, Jane?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Still on the books. Well, maybe I got the sequence wrong on this, John. The main thing I remember is that Weicker was watching the news one night.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Could be. You may be right on this. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And there was a special on about—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Geraldo Rivera or something?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. It wasn’t Willowbrook, but it was sort of like Willowbrook. This happened ten years after Willowbrook and it was awful. It was like a <span class="work-title">60 Minutes</span> thing and they showed basically that nothing had changed in institutions all across the country. I remember him coming to work the following day and I wasn’t there, but this is the story I remember you telling me. He called you up there and said, “What in the hell is going on? We are doing an investigation. This is outrageous.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s probably right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Because he was very familiar with Southbury. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And you know, some of these issues with institutions in Connecticut I think when he had been a Representative in the House— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>State Rep?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. No. Well, maybe both.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>It was, because now I know where you’re going with this. Yes, go ahead.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Just to say that one of the greatest political favors you could do for a constituent was to get their kid into an institution. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> To bump the waiting list for them. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s exactly right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes, and now here he is seeing all these people being just treated horribly. It was one of those moments where his righteous outrage just really propelled us into this whole trajectory that resulted in some pretty powerful changes in legislation. That’s what I remember, John. I know that Brad Reynolds was involved at some point, and Madeline Will. They went out— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And Maggie Heckler, remember that? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, yes. Oh, do I ever, with the muffins. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh yes, but wait, let me tell Phyllis this. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who is Maggie?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Maggie Heckler was a former congresswoman who was then Secretary of HHS, Health &amp; Human Services Department, a member of the President’s Cabinet. We did these investigations and produced the results and everything else and invited Maggie to testify before Labor HHS. We didn’t have jurisdiction to force her to in Handicap, but the Appropriations Subcommittee did. She wouldn’t come. Offered to send surrogates. Wouldn’t come. Wouldn’t come. Wouldn’t come. We made it very plain to her people that we were serious about this. That didn’t make any difference. She wasn’t going. The Reagan people had a certain arrogance about them until you really whacked them on the side of the head, so Claudia did this, God bless her. It was a great idea. I didn’t do it. </p>
          <p>An emergency supplemental appropriations bill was going through. They tagged an amendment onto it that stripped Heckler’s car down to a Ford Comet from a Lincoln. Cut her travel budget to, what? A thousand bucks a year. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And a few other things like that. [laughter] She couldn’t have gone to the Metro station without walking, and it got on the floor. It was actually reported out. Well, then she decided she’d come testify. Claudia will remember that incident. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> That was very funny.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Do you remember that, Jane?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, I do.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>We didn’t do it. I mean, not that we wouldn’t have, but we didn’t have the authority to do it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And then when she finally came to testify, she brought muffins. [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh yes, is that right? One of the newsletters describes that in here. When would that have been? ’83, ’84?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I think so. That was ridiculous. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>[laughs]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who were the muffins for?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, to try to make nice to the chairman of the Committee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Ahh, are you kidding me? [laughter] That was going to do a lot of good. Okay, well, in any case, Phyllis, from July of 1984 through December of ’84, I took a leave of absence. I went down the street, down Constitution, and set up the National Council because they had nothing, and the administration wasn’t giving them any help in terms of offices. The law had passed. We now had this independent thing, right? But they wouldn’t give them anything. So we worked some magic and we got them on the eighth floor of the Department of Transportation building right across from the old Hirshhorn, if you know where that is. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh yes, right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>There wasn’t a better place down there. Brand-new furnishings, all the other stuff that comes with creating an office. I went down there to do that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You did that still as a member of Weicker’s staff?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>No. Here’s what happened, and I gave it to you in my resume. I told Weicker I wanted to do it and he said—excuse me, ladies, “I don’t give a shit what you want to do.” He says, “You can do whatever the hell you want to do as long as you’re running that Handicap Committee.” So what happened was Jane ran the committee and I went down and set up the National Council for six months. </p>
          <p>Two or three days a week—it was brutally hot that summer—I’d troop up the hill in the afternoon, one or two o’clock, after I’d gotten things more or less taken care of at the Council. I’d come back to the Senator and say, “Hey, what’s going on?” and try to sort of catch up. So that was the six-month period. They offered me a job permanently and I said, “No, I’m going back to the Senate.” By that time, however, Claudia had married Lowell, so there was a vacancy as staff director, and I did not want to take it, but he rode me around in a car one day up here in Connecticut and convinced me that I should do it, so I took over Appropriations.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And that makes two of us. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What do you mean makes two of you?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Well, when John took that job, they offered me John’s job. I was a single parent at the time. How old was Mark? Three years old. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I was going to say five.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> He was in a daycare center and I was also a graduate student. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, you were ABD [all but dissertation], right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> What’s that? Yes, I was trying to work on my dissertation. It was like “I can’t do this.” I mean, there’s no way I can do this. I remember I cried when they offered me the job.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes. That did you a lot of good.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes, well, anyway. [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Weicker is nothing if not persuasive, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Well, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Anyway, so I went off to Appropriations, but effectively I was gone from July 1, 1984. Does that make any difference to what we’re doing here today? Nothing, except Jane was running these investigations.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. You were running the investigations about the institutions?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>The institutions.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> The institutions, yes. We had a team—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> —and it was interesting. Weicker pulled staff from all of the various sorts of pots he had. He had a personal staff, a Small Business staff because he chaired Small Business, a Labor HHS Appropriation staff because he chaired that, and then the Disability Committee staff, so the team was me and Steve Snider. He put Steve Snider in charge of it. Steve Snider was our communications person, but he also had a background in investigative journalism.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Investigations, that’s right. Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> So Steve was the lead investigator person on this— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> —and Terry Muilenburg.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>He’s with NEA [National Education Association], by the way. He’s the vice president down there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Right. Is he a vice president?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I thought so, last I heard, yes. He fooled somebody. I don’t know.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> He worked with NEA all the time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He is someone I want to speak to also. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> So Terry and Bob Wilson from Small Business—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s right. Wilson was part of it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes, he was. I went to Georgia. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I forgot that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Wilson was an African American man.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And a hell of a baseball player, too. It was the only thing that kept our softball team alive. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Well, I will never forget that Terry and I, who were white women, and Bob Wilson went to Georgia together and we are in the middle of nowhere. I mean, some of these institutions are just—you’d think you were in another planet, and here are the three of us driving down the road in the middle of nowhere and these police cars pull alongside us. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh my God. Oh. Shades of the ’60s, huh? [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> We must’ve visited—we had a schedule and we picked out our institutions really based on what we thought was going to be the most egregious, the large ones. We went everywhere, from Utah to California—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Connecticut, Utah, I know. Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Connecticut. We were all over the place, and it’s pretty amazing. We had a protocol of questions we would put together and we would show up completely unannounced.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But sometimes you did this undercover and sometimes you did it as—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Well, we didn’t lie about why we were there—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Didn’t Snider get a job some place? He did. Didn’t he kind of fabricate a resume and get a job as an attendant?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I think that’s true. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. I thought— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I think he might have. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>He did something.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I think he did. Those reports are still available. Do you have copies of those?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>No, I don’t, Jane. The only thing I kept up was the newsletters and a few personal things.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I bet you could find them, Phyllis.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I think they’re probably part of the archival materials at the University now.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Now, I bet they are, because we had three hearings, April 1, 2, 3. I’ll never forget, on April 1 it was the lead story on ABC, NBC and CBS.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In 1986? ’84?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I think, was it ’84?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>No, I think it was ’85, Jane.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> It was. You’re right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Because I was at Appropriations when your guy did this.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> ’85, because I actually Googled it this afternoon because I was trying to figure out exactly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, wonderful. Two points. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> It’s April 1, 2, and 3, 1985, and so we also issued a report. I hope there’s a copy of that report in the archives. And then there are hearing records, because we had three days of hearings. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And I believe—didn’t we subpoena people, John? I think that we subpoenaed some people to speak.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Jane, you were doing that. I mean, I was interested, but you guys were running that thing.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Didn’t you subpoena actually some of the people who had been in those institutions themselves? No? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I’m thinking we might have subpoenaed some people who used to work there. I am just not 100 percent sure, but I know we subpoenaed people because I remember having to go to legal counsel.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, we needed a full committee. You needed a full Labor and Human Resources Committee jurisdiction to do that because we didn’t have subpoena power.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> John, these were joint hearings.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, with us? On what, Appropriations?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> In Appropriations and Subcommittee on the Handicapped. They were joint hearings. I Googled that, too, to remember that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Okay. God bless you.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. Well, my memory’s not what it used to be, but I remember going to legal counsel and getting the authority to subpoena these people. We were eyewitnesses to some pretty horrible stuff, and Steve had photographs of just awful things. Saddest thing is, I don’t know if you saw the New York Times about a week ago, John, a lead story on the front page about the abuses and poor treatment of people with developmental disabilities in group homes. It was like the exact same thing, but now they’re in group homes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, I could hear you, Jane. I grabbed Snider’s Rolodex contact information and I want to give it to Phyllis.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh fantastic. That’s fantastic. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, good. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="005118"></a>0:51:18</p>
          <p class="c-header">Policy issues in special education</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So while John is out of the room, I’m wondering if we could just back up for a moment, Jane, and for the record if you could just talk a little bit about how you initially got involved with Lowell Weicker and part of his staff and what your preparation had been for that prior to coming into that office.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, sure. I actually came to the office in I believe it was February of 1982.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s correct. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Is that right, John?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes. Phil Burke had told me about you. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I was there for four years, until when the Senate switched over and we got in the minority and I left. This was my placement as part of my doctoral program. I was getting my doctorate in special education. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>The University of Maryland. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> One of the requirements was to have a placement in a public policy organization, and somehow my adviser at the University of Maryland knew John. I don’t know how—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>A crazy Irishman named Phil Burke.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> That’s right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Wasn’t he department chair?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes, he still is. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Is he? Oh, you’re kidding. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, my God. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Jesus! </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, geez.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>A great guy, and if he was nothing else, he was an advocate for the students he believed in. He really believed in Jane and her capacity. I’d never met her. He forced me to interview her and it was the best thing I ever did.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, please. That’s very sweet of you.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Well, you and Hardman are tied. I can’t favor one of you over the other.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, that’s very sweet of you. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you had had no sort of political involvement? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, no. I was in special ed. I was a teacher. I’d been a special education teacher and a special education administrator and I was interested in policy, though I knew nothing about it, and the doctoral program had sort of an angle on policy.</p>
          <p>I was there for six months as an intern, basically, and then when the internship ended, John had an opening and he hired me. Much to the dismay of the University, I didn’t go back for my dissertation. I stayed on for four years and it was finally when I left that I finished, but I’ll never forget the first meeting I went to as a staff person and people are sitting around talking about state grants and discretionary programs. I remember thinking, What did I get myself into? I do not know what they’re talking about.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. I would be right there with you in that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I really learned on the job.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. </p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> No question about it. I had the personal experience of having taught, and knowing what the real world was like in terms of providing an education for students with disabilities, working with parents, that sort of thing. I think that’s why that agenda that John talked about of being client-centered so resonated with me, because I had been a teacher and I had seen how the parents needed support and how the students weren’t getting what they needed and that sort of thing.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. That makes a lot of sense. Were those also the years then when this whole notion of client-supported programs in education would have been current? Because I’m not quite sure in terms of thinking about education and how to support educational programs. Was this notion of client-centeredness pretty current? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> You know, I don’t think so. I really think that was a philosophy of the Subcommittee and it was a strategy that John, to his great credit, really developed and unfolded. I really do credit that philosophy with laying the groundwork for the Americans With Disabilities Act, that real notion of we are here to champion the people who are to be served. It was very empowering, and I think it really had a significant impact as far as bringing the disability community together down the road. It certainly wasn’t immediate.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Well, thank you, Jane. I hope half that’s true. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So, Jane, you started in February ’82. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But with no real knowledge of legislative and government matters.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> That’s right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And by 1984 you were a staff director to that committee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. Welcome to the United States Senate. [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span><span class="work-title">The Last Plantation</span>. There was a book published at the time named that because of the absence of employee protections and civil rights in the Congress, Senate and House. The author of that book, whoever it might have been, called the Congress “the last plantation,” the inference being that the staff there were treated like slaves.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Well, also remember that I learned from the master. I learned from John. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, well of course. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I mean that very sincerely because I was able to be under his tutelage for two years and just had the best training I could ever have.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s awfully kind of you, Jane. Let’s not leave out Morris and Hardman, because both those guys were terrific.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I don’t think it’s that unusual in the Senate. I mean, look at Terry Muilenburg. She started out as the secretary. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Secretary. That’s exactly right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And then she became the staff director of the Labor HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, so it’s not that unusual in the Senate to have that sort of trajectory.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you think it’s not that unusual in the Senate in general, or do you think it also had something to do with how Lowell Weicker used his own staff people?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> That’s a good question. I think it’s a little bit of both.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes. Kennedy got good staff people. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Ellin Nolan started as the receptionist in Stafford’s office. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Stafford I was just going to say. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And then she became the staff director of the Education Subcommittee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>When Polly left? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes, right, after Polly left, so I think it’s a little bit of both. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Infused in all this is the Kennedy Foundation, whatever you may think of Eunice Shriver and her ways. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think a lot of her.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>They sponsored a national fellowship that I think was competitive each year.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> You know, it still is, John. I’m on the board now, I should expose, and it’s still going on.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Well, Hardman and Morris were both Kennedy fellows. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> That’s right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>So they came out of wherever they were. Hardman was from Utah. Mike was director of Arc in Georgia, as I remember.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> That’s right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And if you won this competition, they supported you and you got a chance to go up on the Hill and beg for a job. You didn’t have a placement, but you had to find one. Well, even a dolt like me could figure out that these very bright, talented, and experienced people in parts of the disability world were something to be had. If I could get them for nothing—so that’s where both Hardman and Morris came from. Jane, as she told you, came from an academic background from the University.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Could you talk to me just a little bit about how the day-to-day work of this Committee went on in terms of the interactions among and between staff, and then the interactions with other Senators, in particular, and the way in which the Committee worked separate from the staff? Just if you could talk me through a sort of process.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Well, it was episodic. During parts of the year, typically January to June, the authorizing committees and subcommittees were active. After that, the game shifted to the appropriations side. That continues to this day, if you think about it. You get all the hearings in the spring and summer of Education and Labor and pensions, well, Labor in the Senate and all that, and then it shifts to the appropriations bills coming out in advance of the October 1 fiscal year and/or the continuing resolution that we’re seeing right now that continues into March. </p>
          <p>We’d see more of the Committee members of the Subcommittee on the Handicapped at the times of either hearings or mark-ups on these various initiatives that we’ve mentioned, principally in the springtime. We wouldn’t see them after that. Now, each of them had a staff person. Some of those staff persons were very supportive. A woman that’s now deceased, Marcia Verville, was Ted Eagleton’s—what’s his first name? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thomas?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Tom Eagleton. Labor &amp; Human Resources person, Marcia Verville. She was wonderful, just absolutely wonderful, supportive and helpful. </p>
          <p>There was another member’s staff person who was a pain in the ass trying to sabotage everything we did if she got a chance. Fortunately, she was part of the Democratic minority and Kennedy had issued an edict that they don’t get in the way of what we were trying to do, so she was essentially neutralized, but she could’ve been a severe problem had she not been. You know who I’m referring to, Jane?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I think so. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>She had a deaf son, remember? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> What’s that? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>She had a deaf son. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, yes, I’m on the page with you. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>But those were minor annoyances. Jane probably had a lot more interface with Polly Gault in education than I did, for instance, and her staff. Ellin—who was that woman from UVM [University of Vermont] that was a fellow there for a couple of years, Jane?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Susan Hasazi. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s right. Very good. She was actually a master later in one of the institutionalization cases here in Connecticut. The federal court appointed her the master.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And then remember Sue Ellen Walbridge? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, Jesus, yes. So we had staff interactions. Until I got to Appropriations, I didn’t have a whole lot to do with members. I’d see them, occasionally get a question from one if they’d see me hanging around and they had disability questions they’d ask me, but I reported to Weicker. That’s the Senator I— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How often would you see him during the course of a day?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, pretty regularly. While they were in session, Weicker had sufficient seniority so he had what was called the hideaway office. Are you familiar with those? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Okay. And Weicker outfitted his just like everybody outfitted theirs, as an ice bar, so regularly, probably two days a week when they were in session, the staff directors, and that would be Claudia, [Robert] Dotchin, me, Geoff Baker, the legislative director— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Kim Elliott?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>—would wander up. Yes, Kim Elliott later, not initially. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Dotchin was her surrogate. We’d go up to the hideaway, have a couple of drinks and these God-awful cheese sandwiches that Weicker thought were wonderful that he’d cut into squares. [laughter] Jesus. A wonder we didn’t all die. We’d just go over the events of the day, and those meetings ranged really from the fundraising calls, pick up the phone and call Sammy to get a check; to setting up the campaigns, to substantive discussions on the issues. I remember there was big debate on Reagan’s tax cut bill of ’82 or ’83, and the consensus was, and I’m not sure to this day that Weicker was really convinced, but the consensus of the group was that heading into an election he had to vote for this thing, and he did. </p>
          <p>Why do I say that? Well, because the conversations during those hideaway meetings and the get-togethers of the staff—and you want to remember we were separated by fair distances. When we started out in the Handicapped Subcommittee, we were in the basement of the Russell Building.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> That’s right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And it was dank. It was right next to the underground men’s room. We were subterranean, too, so I don’t need to draw you any pictures. We improved our situation some and moved into the Hart Building when it opened on the first floor right at the entranceway. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Beautiful, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>It was premier space, and then in Appropriations, it got even better for me. My office was about twice the size of this conference room you’re sitting in with its own private bath and everything else. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Very nice. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>It was just luxurious. Anyhow, so a lot of interaction with the Senator, a particular lot of interaction as we headed to the ’82 re-election, which was very difficult. We won it against a very competent opponent who’s now, by the way, Jane, the lobbyist for Egypt or was under, what’s his name, [Hosni] Mubarak.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Who was?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>[Toby] Moffett. He was the lobbyist for Mubarak’s regime. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh my. Holy— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>So here’s the Ralph Nader consumer advocate kind of gone over to the dark side, I’d say, wouldn’t you?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Follow the money.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, follow the money. That’s right. Anyway, so that’s the answer to that question. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you would see him—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>A lot. But if he were doing something in another committee that had him riveted, or let’s take something neutral. He was one of the leaders in the opposition to apartheid and actually chained himself to the fence down there at the South African Embassy in the days before Nelson Mandela and all that. Well, organizing and developing and doing that kind of stuff’s a lot of work. You don’t just dream it up one fine morning and wander down there, and so when he’d be engaged in an activity like that that I had no responsibility for, I’d just stay out of the way. Why bother? </p>
          <p>A lot of times Jane and Mike, and Mike and others on the staff would get frustrated with me because I wouldn’t get a decision on a matter of policy they were working on and I didn’t do it because I knew I’d get my head handed to me because he was thinking about something else or I’d get the wrong decision. But, no, I had no problem with either access, and as I say, the biggest thing for me, and I think any other staff person, including Claudia, will tell you this—was authority. I mean, we could act with a fair amount of impunity. </p>
          <p>We knew what his priorities were and we knew we were responsible and we knew we’d get size 13 right square in the you know where if and when we screwed up, which everybody did, by the way, at one time or another. I wasn’t fast enough off the mark on then Secretary [Terrel] Bell’s attempt to rewrite special ed regulations, and Weicker sent me into left field to get my attention that we should attend to it. But those were the rules. That’s how it was.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I think it’s fair. John, too, was a very senior, very much respected staffer. I mean he was in a very small circle of people who I think Weicker had complete and total confidence in. The rest of us would certainly interact with Weicker, and I think that John also conferred to us that sense of autonomy. I mean, one of the things I liked so much working up there is that if you came up with a really good idea and it was philosophically aligned with what we were trying to do, you really were able to run with it with great confidence, and you also knew that Weicker would back you up.</p>
          <p>I’m thinking of that hearing that we had, John, on that bill to overturn the [Tommy] <span class="court-case">Smith v. Robinson</span> Supreme Court decision, the Handicapped Children’s Protection Act. We had a lot of detractors and we decided not to invite them to testify at the hearing. They got really mad and Weicker just told them off. It was this real sense that if you were philosophically advocating for the kids, he would have your back. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And that was very— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>You know, I did him a disservice. I’ve been focusing here on what a demanding taskmaster he was and not at all polished a lot of times, but that’s exactly right. That was inside. Outside, he defended your back, too.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’ve heard this from a lot of people as well. This is very consistent with some of the other people that I’ve done interviews with.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> It was very motivating and just really made you feel like what you were doing really made a difference and that you were engaged in something really important. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’d like to ask what you think the greatest obstacles to your work and the achievement of these legislative initiatives and passage of bills was. Was the greatest obstacle simply other congresspersons who weren’t supportive? Was the obstacle more from the executive side of the street? Was it not philosophically motivated but simply economically motivated? How do you assess that? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I’ll give you my answer, and this is an honest one. I didn’t give a rat’s ass about the politics. I knew we could beat Reagan. I knew we had the issue. I knew we had the Senate. I knew we had the Committee. My biggest problem, and it reflected itself in some of those answers I gave you about the National Council, was I ran out of good ideas. I mean, I’m not omniscient. I don’t know about this stuff. Jane and Mike were terrific, and if it weren’t for them, I would have had very little grounding. </p>
          <p>I ran a charity, the Easter Seal Society. We worked with handicapped people and stuff and we had recreational programs and what was then called Sheltered Workshops and things like that, plus a modicum of speech and other medical therapies. </p>
          <p>The biggest fear I had was that I was wasting my time, because I had all the authority in the world. In ’83 I had both the authorizing and appropriating authority in the Senate, and by that time, the House just took a dive when Weicker wanted something. I’m not saying that out of any misconceived—he did. That was the statute we got. So we weren’t worried about the White House. We never got invited down there for anything, but we weren’t worried about them, the other Senators. We could roll them on any vote we had. We had conservatives of the rankest order voting for all the disability stuff. They all came out of Handicap unanimously. Strom Thurmond voted for all this shit. I mean, come on. So— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Unanimous consent on the floor, John.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s right. So the biggest problem I had, and Jane can answer the question for herself, is a lot of times I’d go home saying, <em>You know, Doyle, you’re wasting your time down here. What the hell have you done today?</em> And there was nobody that could give you, even friends of mine that were lobbyists for various disability groups—Dick Verville, Jane, would be one example. Joe Romer at Easter Seals. Good men, good solid men, but you know what? They told you what they wanted you to hear because they were getting paid to do it. So that’s another reason why I wanted the National Council, because I wanted some honest broker that could give me ideas. Jane, you answer from your perspective.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> That’s really interesting. I think of one situation. I think it’s probably varied somewhat depending on what you were working on. I think for the most part we got what we wanted, I would say.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> We really did. And that was the kind of leader Weicker was. I mean Weicker was a big, tough guy, and frankly, people didn’t want to stand up and argue with him, especially over this stuff, so he was a commanding presence with a very strong and deep commitment here, and I think it sort of opened a path for us that was pretty remarkable. There’s one thing I remember, in 1985-86 we were again doing a reauthorization bill on IDEA.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>That’s special ed. It became known as IDEA.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="011128"></a>1:11:28</p>
          <p class="c-header">Initiatives in early childhood legislation</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> One of Weicker’s great initiatives was this early childhood legislation. I’ll never forget this. He had a hearing and he has a son, of course, with mental retardation, and this hearing was about getting access to services right after the kids are born, at a very early time. At that time this was done on a state-by-state basis. In other words, some states would provide services the day the kid was born. Other states, you got nothing until the kid went to school, so in this hearing, we had people from different states talking about this and one parent saying I got nothing and the other parent saying I got everything. </p>
          <p>Weicker lived in Virginia at the time, which was a state that had provided them with all these services for their son from the day he was born. I’ll just never forget him smashing his fist down on the table and saying, “What do you mean we wait until they go to school? That’s ridiculous. They need these services from the day they’re born. We’re changing that.” </p>
          <p>Those were our marching orders, and we crafted this legislation that basically would have started special education and related services at birth and we got it passed and sent it over to the House, where the Democrats were in charge. Now, we’re the Republicans and we’re in charge in the Senate. “Oh, no, we can’t do that, it costs too much. We can’t give due process rights to parents of newborns,” this and that. </p>
          <p>So we had a very challenging negotiation with them and we did not get that mandate from birth. We got a discretionary program that continues to exist to this day and continues to struggle, and that’s like the example that comes to my mind of very few times when we didn’t really get pretty much exactly what we wanted. And it, you know, was the House process, basically. It was the House. The House works a little differently, and they have a lot more input from their school districts and that kind of thing. That’s the one example that I remember. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And I know, of course, that Sonny [Weicker] was born with Down’s syndrome, and I know that Lowell Weicker’s interest in these issues actually preceded the birth of Sonny.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, they did. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But I’m wondering, when you said to me just now, John, that nobody really fought with Lowell Weicker on these issues—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Jane said that, but I nodded. Yes, that’s right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And whether there’s any relationship there—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>No, you know, that’s a double-edged sword. Jane, you didn’t even know this. I was the guardian of my first cousin until she passed away about five years ago. She was a Mansfield survivor.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> No kidding.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes. I never told anybody, and you know why I didn’t tell anybody? It wasn’t I was ashamed of Maddie or anything else, but right away they’d say, “Well, Doyle’s only interested in this because he’s got a disabled relative, and that was not true. It was not true, just plain and simple, and I always sort of semi-resented it that everybody said, “Weicker’s interested in this because he’s got a kid.” Before he was married to his second wife, he was helping out at the Easter Seal place to get that 316 money funded, Jane, the special rec under the Rehab Act. He worked a deal with [Robert] Byrd. Byrd got something in West Virginia and he got money in 316. It was then an unfunded part of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act. </p>
          <p>There are tons of unfunded authorizations in Washington. Unless you put some money to it, nothing happens, and he got Byrd to go along when he was in the minority to do this and that because he was—Phyllis met him—that was the first time Phyllis Zlotnick met him—the principal advocate for the disabled here in Connecticut. Sure, that meant a lot. People would say, “You’ve got to give Lowell his way because he’s got a handicapped kid. He feels strongly about that.” But I never liked that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I don’t think that was the predominant. I think it was his presence, his conviction, and his nature and his philosophy about this. I don’t remember a lot of talk like that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, it actually coincides in some ways with his philosophy, for example, about funding for AIDS. He didn’t have a particular relationship with that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Exactly. Very good. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>We got kind of involved in that. I got dragged off to run that first hearing that he and D’Amato ran. Remember, Jane?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I remember that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Jane, I don’t know where the hell Claudia was, but I got stuck running that thing, and what Reagan wanted to do—this is a funny story—when I got to Appropriations, of course, I was responsible for the AIDS funding. It was still in the very early years of any sort of research, and so I’m trying to figure out what kind of a number to put in. Do you remember this story, Jane?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> No, I don’t think I do.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Well, what’s her name, down at NIH? Oh, Florence Haseltine. She runs population studies down at NIH. We got to be friends when we were flying back and forth to D.C. She’s crazier than you are, but a great friend. In fact, I took her down to Bonair a few years ago with my wife and we went diving together. She’s really a hot shit. She’s got about three PhDs plus an M.D., and I don’t know what the hell they all are. Anyway, her brother is [William] Haseltine, the hot shit doctor from around the Boston area. Do you remember him?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh. Haseltine Clinic.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, exactly, so he came in one day and Weicker told me to see him, so I had him in the office at Appropriations, just the two of us. I don’t think Bongard was even there, and he goes through this whole highfalutin’ toot, it was just—“We need the money in AIDS and the sort of research we can unleash, and these promising scientists can have—” I let him go. He went on and it was really marvelous, and he was a first-class bullshit artist. Boy, I’ll tell you. He was good. </p>
          <p>So, I said, “Good, Doctor. Now I got a question for you. I got a line I got to fill out here in the Appropriations bill. How much am I supposed to put in it?” I said, “Now, let me give you the problem. If I put too much in, the reactionaries out there in the Congress are going to seize on every one of those NIH grants that turns up to be tea service for some university out in California, right? Or a yacht or whatever the hell they used the money for in the indirect account.” And I said, “If I don’t put in enough, you’re going to be screaming that there’s all these promising areas of research that aren’t going to be funded and Weicker will be on my tail for doing it, so how much do I put in?” “Oh, well, I can’t tell you that.” I said, “What do you mean, you can’t tell me? If you don’t tell me, who is going to tell me?” </p>
          <p>I told Florence this story later. She laughed like hell. She said, “That’s him, all right.”  But that was the sort of problem you had that you couldn’t get a straight answer. I mean, everybody would tell you what was good for them, but they’d just say, “Good, here I am. Here’s the bill.” I’ve got to put a number down here on this line that says AIDS research for NIH. What number should I put in? You’re an advocate, you tell me. And he wouldn’t do it. It was the damn funniest thing. That’s one of those stories you remember and say, “Yeah, great.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But all these things are going on simultaneously, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The money for the issues over funding of NIH and AIDS research in 1985, it’s the same. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>In fact, the AIDS and Jane’s institutional abuse hearings, those are roughly contemporaneous, and we all got dragged into those.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, right. It must’ve been a very intense time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, that’s why I’m saying some of these things. I mean, that’s why if I had— Jane was busy and I was busy, maybe Hardman and Morris or whoever we had on staff, they could’ve been doing stuff independent that was as significant as anything we’re talking about, but we don’t remember it because we didn’t do it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We haven’t gotten into this at all, but John, can you just tell me how you got involved initially?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, sure, politics. My avocation in the beginning in college was politics, okay?  That’s what I liked to do. Like people like to play golf or do other stuff, I like politics. It’s what I did in college, politics, and then I got out and did it in Republican politics, and then I started working for this guy who’s my congressman running for Governor, and in the summer of ’70, I took a leave of absence from my teaching job and one fine day the Governor-to-be came in and there were nine of us running the campaign statewide and he said, “Look, this guy Weicker’s going to be our nominee for Senate. I’m supporting him. There’s going to be a primary. You’re supporting him, too. Anything you can do to help him, help him.” I said, “Okay, I got that.” </p>
          <p>What I didn’t realize, the other guys on the staff who were largely from blue-collar towns with ethnic backgrounds had a fair amount of disdain for Weicker’s Fairfield County crowd, okay? I mean they did. But nobody told me that. I didn’t get that memo. I mean, literally, I can give you individuals who can tell you that. The territory I had was contiguous with Fairfield County, so I had a couple of big rallies at these huge malls. I called Weicker’s people and said, “Hey, you guys want to show up? You’re supposed to be on the ticket with us.” “Oh, yeah.” </p>
          <p>So I met him. We became friends, and in the intervening years I went to work for [Tom] Meskill. And when he’d come back home, if he was up in my part of the state, he’d pull into my house. This is a true story. He and his staff, [Dick] Benson and [Hank] Harper primarily, Jane— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>They would drink all the beer they could find in the house, use the bathroom, miss as often as hit. The place was a shambles when they left. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs] Oh, geez. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>The kids remember them throwing the ball around to my kids, my older boys, and it was just that informal. I mean, then all of a sudden, he knew I was working in the disability area and ran Easter Seals in Connecticut, which is actually a respectable job, and when he got to be, unexpectedly, chairman of Handicapped and in the majority, he called me up. He said, “Do you want to come down here?” and I said, “Can I get a chance to think about it?” He said, “Yeah. Call me tomorrow.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you ran Easter Seals in Connecticut? That was your job?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes. That was my job.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You were the executive director?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I was. That’s in there. I gave you my bio. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, okay. Thank you. Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes. We had seven outpatient rehab centers. It was about a $20 million-a-year operation.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you joined his staff then in ’81?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Eighty-one. February or thereabouts. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Jane gave you her professional background and how she got there with Phil Burke and everything else. Mine was strictly political. So what did that have to do with anything? What it had to do with something was I then walked in with a trust level that no other staffer was going to have unless they had a similar background. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Absolutely.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And there weren’t many. Bob Dotchin was one. I got a pass on the loyalty quotient, which meant sort of an imprimatur for anything I wanted to do in terms of authority. I mean, I could be wrong, but I wasn’t poorly motivated in terms of protecting his backside. So— </p>
          <p>And by the way, there’s a question you have where the antecedent isn’t clear and it seems to suggest that I’m a liberal Republican. It couldn’t be farther from the truth. I’m actually fairly conservative. My wife calls me a troglodyte. Of course, she’s very liberal, and I would like to tell you something you might not know about Lowell Weicker. In 1984, [sic] [1964] he was a [Barry] Goldwater delegate to the national convention. I have this on the account of the then state Republican chairman, a wonderful man named A. Searle Pinney, that Weicker confronted Pinney in his office and demanded four more delegates for Goldwater be taken away from Rockefeller. If you go farther through the ’70s, you’ll find Lowell Weicker along with Tom Meskill as co-sponsors of the school prayer amendment. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Whoa. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really? Really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So when Weicker gets on his high horse about Doyle being the House Republican reactionary or whatever it might’ve been that day, everybody’s got sins. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh wow. Wow. I had no idea. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Whoa. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It certainly isn’t in his book. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yeah, right. No. He missed. He forgot that. Anyway, what’s the point? The point for your purposes is that Lowell started out as fairly conservative. Now, by today’s terms, that assumes proportions that—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I like to think if you were a Goldwater Republican in 1964, not only did you believe that Goldwater is right, but you probably still think so today and you probably have some pride in it, and I think he was a wonderful man, you want to know the truth, and I got to meet him when I was in the Senate. That doesn’t mean you agree with him, but you know, you say conservative today and it’s some whack job. [laughter] I don’t know. I don’t want to get into it. It was a different time, but Weicker was part of that ’64 conservative movement and very much an advocate, and an involved advocate. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>While I’m thinking of it, and I know this doesn’t have to do anything with handicapped issues, but in his book, he says that after he lost the ’88 election to [Joseph] Lieberman that he’s sort of thinking about what he’s going to do and, excuse me just for a moment, Jane, because this probably doesn’t involve you, but he says in his book that there was a dinner meeting at his house and that you and Dotchin were there and he says that you had privately been plotting with Dotchin to encourage him to run for Governor.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And as an Independent. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And as an Independent, exactly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And, well, there was a practical view that Jane can associate with. In 1988, Weicker had run. His heart wasn’t it. I don’t want to take anything away from Lieberman, but clearly it was less than a vigorous campaign.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He has said that himself on tape.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Anyway, but Lieberman won, and that’s what counts in politics. In any case, during that campaign, Weicker, because he was the Republican nominee, was forced to go visit town committees and do the sort of retail politics that you must do. I don’t care if you’re Dick Blumenthal, Joe Lieberman, or anybody else, Dan Malloy, the current Governor of Connecticut. If you want to get yourself elected, you get your tail to where you have to be in your party and secure your nomination and then move off to the larger population. </p>
          <p>Weicker hated it. After years of opposing, to go before town committees who excoriated him, and where if there had ever been a primary, he’d have gotten beat hands down in the Republican Party. He’d have never gotten the nomination. There just wasn’t an opposition to him. He’d occasionally take it out on the staff that put him up to going to those town committees, and even though I was in the private sector two or three years, I stayed involved, obviously, in what was going on, and so did Dotchin, and we quickly came to the conclusion that we didn’t want to go through another year of that, of getting our head handed to us because we told them we had to go see Republicans, which is what he had to do if he wanted to get the nomination, and so we said you’ve got to run as an Independent, because otherwise it’s not in our interest.  Now, we didn’t quite phrase it like that, but that’s the way it came down. </p>
          <p>Tom D’Amore, my friend and business partner, one of those aforementioned nine that worked for Meskill back in ’70, is quoted in <span class="work-title">The Hartford Courant</span> saying if he ran as an Independent, he, D’Amore, would not support him. Of course, he did, and became campaign manager. </p>
          <p>But, yes, we had had a series of meetings. Weicker was running an outfit called Research America at the time. It was based down in Old Town, down by the river. On more than a few occasions, Dotch and I would show up. My office was in Reston, so it was a great drive at five o’clock at night to meet him there. I mean, you know what that’s like on the Beltway.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And we’d go off and have a couple of drinks. Claudia would be there. Kim would be there. It was sort of a different crew, whoever happened to be around, and we would generally go over the political stuff. It was clear Weicker was anxious and interested in getting back in. The state political climate was in turmoil. The Governor was thought likely not to run, which he didn’t, and so that created all kinds of possibilities, and we honestly thought—I mean, I kid a little bit about not wanting to get our head handed to us by forcing Weicker to be a Republican when he didn’t want to be—but in point of fact, it was the best course to take to get elected, too, and, yes, Dotchin and I did do that.</p>
          <p>One thing I made a note of here, and you’re probably not going to do it because she’s his wife, but I would not ignore the professional contributions of Claudia Weicker.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’ve had a two-and-a-half hour interview with her. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, okay.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We’ve done it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Because on her own, professional Claudia, not Mrs. Weicker—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>She’s fantastic.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>We did not always agree on stuff, okay, but that’s not the point. I’ll tell you something on disability. There was not a time when I went to her for money for any of the programs we’re talking about or things Jane and I talked about, we got this funded or we got that funded. Well, before I took over that job, there wasn’t a time I went to her that I didn’t get any—whatever I got there—put in the budget. No nonsense, no nothing. So that’s worth saying.</p>
          <p>The other guy you ought to talk to is Bob Dotchin, because he ran a completely separate operation from ours. We were both senior staff. He’s also, like me, from Connecticut. His mother was part of the Republican staff in the state house here. I knew her when I worked for Meskill, so Dotch had sort of the same shield on that I did. He was trusted because he was from the state. He knew the state. He knew the politics, and so he could be wrong and get his head handed to him, but the trust factor was there and he had the same sort of discretion within his jurisdiction as I did and Jane did after me.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He’s in D.C., right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, I can get you his stuff if you want it. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="012855"></a>1:28:55</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s greatest contributions </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. That should be easy for me to do. So could we just talk a little bit about—  I know we’ve been focusing on disabilities, but what do you each see as Senator Weicker’s greatest contributions as a congressman, Senator, and maybe Governor, but basically while in Congress? I know you worked on these issues specifically, but if you look—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Well, it was before my time—Watergate has to be the biggest. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You think so?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I’d like to tell you it was disability or it was handicap rights or the South African business, Jane, or any of this, AIDS research, which I thought was pretty damn important. As any American knows or should know or probably will know, Weicker is the Republican champion for the Watergate Committee doing the right thing, and that’s his biggest accomplishment. I don’t know how you can argue with that. I don’t think that’s debatable.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He doesn’t say that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, but he’s not the audience. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> What does he say?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, what do you say? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, that’s right. That’s unfair, Jane. That’s right. [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I’ll give you my perspective, but I think my lens to this is quite a bit narrower than that of John, who has a much broader lens. I think in the area of school prayer and abortion rights. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Will you excuse me for a minute?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I think the number of times that he went over there and took Jesse Helms on, I mean, there must’ve been a school prayer amendment every few months and he was always there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I think it’s something he believed with great passion and he was just really an incredible orator, and he had that gift that Ted Kennedy had and a few others, but you don’t hear speeches like that on the Senate floor anymore. </p>
          <p>Then I think abortion. I think that he played a significant role in fighting back those repeated amendments to overturn [Jane] <span class="court-case">Roe v.</span> [Henry] <span class="court-case">Wade</span>. I don’t know. I mean, obviously, the disability stuff I think was very powerful, but as far as a little broader lens, those two are what come to mind for me. I’ve got to go in about five minutes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’ll just tell you for the record what he says were his biggest accomplishments. He lists education, health care, disability issues, and then finally maybe the income tax in Connecticut, which was so necessary.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And Watergate’s not even on there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, no. Watergate’s not on there, but I think you know what he would say in the larger framework is that he had this overwhelming commitment to constitutionality and all these things for him fall under the rubric of support for the Constitution and its basic rights, the protection of basic rights and people.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. Well put. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, if you have to go in five minutes, can you take a couple of minutes to sketch out for me what you see as the ongoing impact of these laws that you started out with in terms of the continuity piece, or do we need longer than your five minutes?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Well, let me start. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That would be great.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> There just is so much. I think one of the things that comes to mind is this whole notion of transition that John talked about. When we were there, we were the first people to really identify this as a significant problem, and that is the movement of students out of school and into the post-secondary world, either the world of work or some kind of further training or that sort of thing. I remember having hearings where we would describe students as all dressed up with nowhere to go. They would complete their education and then they would fall off a cliff, and that continues to be a challenge to this day. Several legislative initiatives to try to address that, things like requiring that students begin to plan for their post–high school life at age 14. It has to be part of the IEP [Individualized Education Program] process now, but he planted the seeds for that, and that continues.</p>
          <p>Certainly the parent training centers. The role of parents continues to be so important, and again, he planted the seeds to provide that support and to say that this is the proper role for the federal government to support parents in their understanding of the law and the exercising of their rights.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And don’t forget the other things about allowing parents to collect court fees when they prevailed in disputes with local boards of education.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I’m glad you brought that up. I actually wrote my dissertation on that law. This was the <span class="court-case">Smith v. Robinson</span> Supreme Court decision. I think that was in 1984. I’ve got a timeline here, 1984. Basically the Court said that you cannot recoup fees. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Our bill said yes, you can. And do you know that there was about three years ago another Supreme Court decision that said the same thing, that says you can’t recoup your fees for independent witnesses? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> We are still working to try to have that overturned.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Twenty-five years later?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> The legislative history is so clear on that. I’ve got it right here in this little book, but I think that was really important in terms of asserting the rights of parents, and that was a great victory, but it’s also a fight that continues to this day. I think the other thing, as far as planting the seeds for the Americans With Disabilities Act, I think that is so true. It really started with that notion John talked about with creating the National Council on Disability, whereby they were required to think about all disabilities in all phases of life—early childhood, school, employment, transportation, work, community living, you know, everything—and up until that time there had never really been a conception of looking across the spectrum. I guess there was with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, but that never was very robust. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And I think putting the National Council there. It’s really not all that surprising that the National Council then came up with this notion of the Americans With Disabilities Act. When I left Weicker’s office, I went to work on the first presidential commission on the HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] epidemic and that was under Reagan. One of the recommendations that he made of that commission was that a civil rights law should be enacted to protect people with HIV, but it shouldn’t be just about HIV, it should be part of a broader disability rights law. A lot of that came from the seeds that Weicker had planted related to AIDS, related to nondiscrimination and disability and, of course the Americans With Disabilities Act continues to be so vital. The other thing is supported employment. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> We didn’t talk about that, John.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>No, we didn’t.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Weicker put that on the map. I’ll never forget working with Tom Bellamy to write that legislation, this concept that people with disabilities didn’t have to, after they finished high school, go into sheltered employment, go into these workshops, go into these jobs where they moved widgets around for the rest of their lives. It was a concept that if you had the right support, if you had a job coach, if you had a work situation that was supportive for you, you could work in a competitive environment with those supports. So, in other words, you bring the supports to the regular environment. You don’t take the person and put the person in a separate environment with a lot of supports, and we turned that into a discretionary program. I think that was in ’83. I’m not sure, John.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I’m not sure, but I think I finally won—I put the money in when I was in Appropriations. That might have gone all the way to ’85. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> And that is still there. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, I know it, but let me tell you another thing, Jane. You’ve forgotten about that. We talked about special ed and rehab. We also reauthorized the Developmental Disabilities Act. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>A much smaller piece, and one of the big things in the Developmental Disability Act was a nationwide system of storefront lawyers for handicapped people. Now, that’s a simple way to put it. It’s called Protection and Advocacy Systems, and I think we quadrupled or quintupled their funding and gave them a ton more authority, including authority to preserve and protect the rights of retarded folks in the institutions. Anyway, all that is background. </p>
          <p>We reauthorized the bill, we put a new mandate into the state councils, and we said to state councils on developmental disabilities, if you want the federal money, you’re going to include in the array of things you do employment-related services. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>The state councils went batshit. They got hold of what’s his name from California, [Henry] Waxman. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Waxman.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>He was chairman of the Committee of Jurisdiction in the House and he said, “No way are you getting that.” His staff made it very plain. So I just didn’t say anything to him and we didn’t hold any conference. We just ignored him for six months, remember, Jane? By this time, the state councils are saying, “Hey, this thing has gone too far. We’re going to be out of funding and our law expires and Doyle’s not doing a thing.” And this is where Weicker backed me up, because several of them came to see him and he said, “I don’t know, go see John. I don’t know what the hell the story is.” But he knew that whatever we were doing—and finally Waxman collapsed. Now, today, to suggest to any DD [Developmental Disabilities] Council in the country that they don’t care or don’t place a priority on employment-related services, they’d laugh you out of the room, but when we proposed it, they opposed the thing. Remember that, Jane?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>And finally Waxman collapsed and we got what we wanted. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But it sounds like from what you’re saying, Jane, and that was very helpful, I like very much that summary of the continuities, the ways in which some of these ideas have continued to support policies in the present. That was great. Thank you for that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Good. I can only say I wish he were still here. It is a bad hole down here now. Let me tell you.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh yes. It was just a few years— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s terrible. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>—after Weicker left the Senate that the new Republican majority eliminated the Handicap Subcommittee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> That’s right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>By that time, I’d long gone from the Hill. In fact, I was back in private business here in Connecticut. I called some of my friends in Washington, Romer, in particular, Jane. I said, “What the hell’s the matter with you guys? You’re letting this committee go.” “Oh, that’s the Republicans. They want to do it. There’s nothing we can do.” And the very committee that gave Weicker his platform and us the opportunity, is gone now. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I see nobody who’s really willing to stand up and really fight.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I know. No. You know, after Weicker left, Ted Kennedy would carry the mantle. He carried the mantle for so many things.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Jane, did I tell you I saw him five years ago? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> No.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes. I had my boat at Menemsha Pond, which is the back end of Martha’s Vineyard, the west end. Not the place you see in the pictures all the time, but the other side of the island and the less populated one. I’m sitting there in the back of the boat because it was rough weather. We couldn’t get out and this little dink pulls up and I see this guy, sort of rotund, white hair. I said, “Who the hell? Son of a bitch, that’s Kennedy.” So I grabbed Christine [Doyle], my wife, and I said, “Look, get your camera. You want a picture of this.” She said, “You’re going over to see him?” I said, “Sure, why not?” </p>
          <p>I went over and a couple of people around him kind of looked at me like, “Who the hell is this guy?” But I had shorts and a tee shirt, so I couldn’t have been hiding an AK-47 or I don’t know, some other weapon, and I went up to him, Jane, and said, “Senator, John Doyle. I did Lowell Weicker’s disability work,” and he gave me a quick look. “I remember you.” Well, that led to 25 minutes of tall tales and salty language and the miserable bastards today and what they’re doing and it was just great. Chris got a picture of the thing, and of course that was the last time I saw him. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>He also said, “Tell Lowell I can still beat him anytime in tennis.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know you said you needed to go.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> I do.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We should probably wrap this up. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Phyllis, John, thank you so much for including me in this.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Jane, thank you. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> A really wonderful trip down memory lane. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Jane, I’m going to be back in touch with you, because I’m going to ask you if you would just sign a release so we can use this material. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m in Washington so I can get it to you very easily and send it to you.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Oh, sure. That’s fine. I think John has all my contact information.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Wonderful. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Yes, I ran that bio sketch that’s on your Web site, too.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you so much for coming up with the time today.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> My pleasure, and John, great to talk to you again.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Jane, we’ve got to get together. Say hi to your husband for me.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Do you ever come down here?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Well, I’ve got two kids down there, one in Washington, what do you call it? Out past Manassas, the other in Washington, Virginia, so I get down every now and then. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> You better call me for lunch.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I’ll do it. You got it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. West: </span><span class="contactmethod">[via telephone]</span> Take care. Bye-bye.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Bye-bye. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I thought you’d like having her on board. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That was wonderful. Thank you. That was really, really helpful. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Well, that dynamic, if you multiply times the four principals I told you, that’s how we got all this stuff done. Imagine four people with that sort of enthusiasm, each of us sort of bringing a different talent. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>I mean, I have nowhere near the skills she does or special education experience, but she hasn’t my skill in politics. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. And this does give you some sense of the dynamic, the human interaction piece and also the expertise piece, and I just didn’t see how we could have four people on the line.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>No, no, that wasn’t my point. I didn’t say it for that reason. You want to know how the Committee worked? That’s how it worked. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know you didn’t. I’m just explaining, and that’s too bad.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>All committees weren’t like that. A lot of them were patronage mills, you know, the people who donated to the campaign, they get their son or daughter—the Senate at that time, and still, is a finishing school for people, for post-graduates to perfect their resume, all right? It is. It really is. And so if you’re a big-time donor, you want your son or daughter who just graduated to have some Senate experience, and so they wind up on staff. They don’t care about the jurisdiction. They don’t know shit from shinola about the jurisdiction. They have no interest in the professional life in their jurisdiction. They just are perfecting their resume and they’re on their way through. It’s sort of like finishing school, you know.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, right. Post-college.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>You got it. We didn’t have that. We all cared, for one reason or another.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I think what’s remarkable about these interviews that I’ve been doing is how deeply involved everyone has stayed in the issues that they became engaged with and how committed everyone is to Lowell Weicker. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>What’s today, the 16th?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>[leaves the room and re-enters] Two weeks ago I accepted that for him. I’ve got to give it to him. You say keeping involved. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh yes? “Presented to Honorable Lowell Weicker in honor of your exemplary leadership and the many years of support to children and adults with developmental and other disabilities.” That’s lovely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Two weeks ago. He was in St. Croix, couldn’t accept. I accepted for him. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. But he clearly had an incredible capacity to make people feel part of an extended family working together on very important issues. The kind of loyalty I think—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Don’t mistake the fact, though, and it’s fair to say for his archives, he was demanding. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, no. I know. He wasn’t just support—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>This wasn’t some fuzzy—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, I understand that. You can’t meet with him for ten minutes without knowing that. Yet people really felt that when they did their work, that he, as you’ve already said in this interview, had your back.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>He had your back and he couldn’t have been more complimentary. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And he cared about you as a person as well, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>When these pieces of legislation would pass, he—I remember once one of the bills passing. I don’t remember what it was. He came down to our office, he demanded all the staff be there, and he spent about ten minutes praising every one of them one by one, right down to the secretaries. He was generous to a fault in that regard. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you all worked your tails off.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>Oh, and you got abused. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. I’m going to turn off the tape now and say thank you very much. This has just been a wonderful afternoon.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">J. Doyle: </span>You’re very welcome. It’s been a real pleasure. </p>
