          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is Phyllis Leffler. The date is August 12, 2010, and I’m in the offices of Kimberly Elliott for an interview in the Lowell Weicker Oral History Project. Good morning, and thank you for agreeing to meet with me about this project.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>It’s my pleasure.<br>
          </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000054"></a>0:00:54</p>
          <p class="c-header">Elliott’s background for work on Senate Small Business Committee</p>
          </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I thought we might begin by asking you to recollect how it was that you got involved with Lowell Weicker, and perhaps as well, just tell us a little bit about your educational background that led you to seek the position that you ultimately ended up with.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I originally got to know him through his chairmanship of the Committee on Small Business. In 1980, the Senate went Republican for the first time in a very long time, and Gaylord Nelson had to relinquish the chairmanship of the Small Business Committee to Lowell Weicker, the Republican. </p>
          <p>In the job I had at that time, I had been doing a lot of work with the small business contractors, construction contractors, and knew a lot about small business labor law, small business contracting, the 8(a) Program, and so Bob Dotchin, who was the staff director of the Committee, called and asked me to interview, to come over to work for the Senate because of my background. He had to hire an entire new staff after the Nelson staff resigned. A few of them stayed in the minority, but the majority staff had to be completely hired, and so I interviewed with Bob. He offered me the job, and it wasn’t until I had been on the job for a couple of weeks that I even actually met Senator Weicker.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How did you know Bob?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I had been working with the Committee on a lot of small business issues on behalf of the organization I worked for called the Associated Builders &amp; Contractors. We were involved with advocacy, so I was involved with both the majority and the minority staff of the Committee and had established a good relationship with both sides of the aisle, so Bob asked if I’d consider coming on as a new staff person, which I said yes to. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Had you been trained specifically to do the kind of the work you were doing?  Were you— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No, not really. I had an undergraduate degree in political science and Spanish and then a master’s degree in Spanish literature, which had nothing to do with any of it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, the political science maybe.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>My first job in Washington was working for a group of Hispanic business owners where I was actually the only native English speaker, and so I worked helping—  It’s the time the 8(a) Program had just been established under President [Jimmy] Carter, and so I became familiar with that program. The law had been written by the Small Business Committee in the Senate before it passed the full Senate, and so I just developed a lot of expertise around small business issues because that’s where I happened to be working.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So what interested you then in switching from a private corporation, basically, or advocacy group, to work directly within the halls of government?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I thought it’d be a great challenge. I’d sort of grown up being very drawn to public service, and I thought it was a great opportunity to become involved in the legislative branch of government, something I’d always been very interested in and studied, and it just seemed like a great opportunity with a brand new Congress, a brand new President, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Was there anything specific at that point about Senator Weicker that drew you in? You said you didn’t meet him for several weeks afterwards. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, in high school I had followed the Watergate hearings, so I knew a little bit about who he was, but I was born in Arizona, raised in California, and had never been to Connecticut. I was born and raised and proud to be a Democrat, so working for a Republican was a little off-putting for me, but since he was a liberal Republican I sort of swallowed and decided to do it. </p>
          <p>I actually went to work because the substance of the work in the Committee interested me much more than Weicker per se, except that I had admired him during Watergate. I actually worked for all of the Republican Senators on the Committee, and frankly did more work for Senator Sam Hayakawa at the time, who was from California, and Senator Orrin Hatch, because they chaired, respectively, the subcommittees where I had the most expertise, one on small business labor law and one on small business procurement law. I had very little actually to do with Senator Weicker, except when he learned that I spoke many languages he was interested in having me translate documents for him. That’s really how I interacted with him for the first year and a half, primarily looking at documents and translating either from French to English or English to French or to Italian or to Spanish.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What sorts of documents, then? Were they documents directly related to this work?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>It was either directly related to the work or directly related to other interests that he had in the personal office, his Senate office as opposed to the Committee office, but he realized he had a linguist on staff, so he used my abilities.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I bet. I’m going to come later to your engagement with the issues in Cuba, but I’ll bet your Spanish background had a lot to do with that as well.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>It did. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you joined the Small Business Committee as a staffer in 1980. Is that right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Right. December of ’80, but really started more in January of ’81 when the Congress actually converted to Republican control, or the Senate did. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>But Bob hired me in December.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What kinds of work did you do directly for that Committee?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I worked a lot on legislation to make it easier for small business owners to get federal contracts, either minority or just small business in general. I ran a series of small business procurement seminars across the country, went to various states where Senators on the Committee were the representatives, and so I did several in Connecticut, California, Utah, various places. I would go and rent a room in a Hilton Hotel and have the Small Business Administration folks come in, talk to small business owners about how they might pursue government contracts, and I also worked substantively and organizationally to launch the first White House Conference on Small Business that was held by President [Ronald] Reagan in 1982.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>A whole group of people clearly must have worked on that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Right. A lot of folks worked on it, but I was the point person for the Senate Committee. Most of the work was done out of the Small Business Administration and the Commerce Department. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>But I was the liaison for the Senate Committee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You said it took about two weeks before you even met then Senator Weicker. Once you did meet him, and you also said you worked for several Senators, once you started working on that committee and began to get to know him, how did that relationship evolve from that initial encounter and beyond?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Honestly, it really didn’t. The work that he was most interested in was not in the subjects I was working on, so really I worked primarily for other Senators. Again, my relationship with him primarily was when I was called to the personal office to look at documents or to do some translation, that sort of thing. He was very cordial. He was lovely, lovely to work for, but he really—and although he was my boss, it was in title only. I really reported more to other Senators on the Committee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You’ve mentioned two. Orrin Hatch, and I’m sorry I didn’t quite get the— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Senator Sam Hayakawa. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Hayakawa, right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Of California. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma. I really don’t remember all the others, to tell you the truth.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, sure. It’s a while ago. So from there you work as a staffer on the Committee on Small Business. When do you actually move over to Senator Weicker’s office as the—</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000910"></a>0:09:10<br>
          <p class="c-header"> Joins Weicker’s personal staff</p>
          </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>He was reelected in November 1982 and I joined the personal staff in January of 1983. So it was after the election. As most Senators do after an election, they sort of review what’s going on in their offices. His long-time legislative director, Geoffrey Baker, had decided to leave and go into a law practice with his wife, and so there was an opening there. Frankly, Bob Dotchin recommended me as someone that had developed a lot of skills in legislation and parliamentary procedure on the Committee, and so he recommended that Senator Weicker interview me for the job. He did, and he offered it to me. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And by then you knew enough about him to know that this would be a desirable change for you?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, watching him overcome a serious primary challenge by President [George H.W.] Bush’s brother, Prescott Bush, who later withdrew, and then winning in a very close race against Toby [Anthony John] Moffett, I really was able to watch him and got to know a lot about his policies and positions, because during a campaign that all becomes front and center, and I really felt very aligned with his position on most major issues, so I thought it would be an interesting job. I was at that time one of the very few women that had the title of legislative director, and was very unique because I wasn’t from his party or from his state, and he took a big risk in hiring me. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you moved immediately into that position of legislative director?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I did. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why do you think he took that risk?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I think he had a lot of confidence in Bob Dotchin’s judgment, and I think that he had seen me work on various projects over the course of two years, even if it was from a distance, and I had developed a strong relationship with his chief counsel at the time, Stan Twardy, and was able to provide Stan and then the campaign a lot of good information about small business issues. I think they liked the way I wrote, they liked the way I dug into the issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You stayed on as legislative director for how many years?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Until he was defeated in 1988, so literally I left the Senate in January of ’89 and actually turned off the lights in the office. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I was the last one out the door.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. That must’ve been difficult. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>That was very difficult. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I can imagine, sure. So you are really in a position between ’83 and ’89 to be watching absolutely everything—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I did. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—that goes on in that office to follow everything and try to organize the way in which issues are dealt with as best you can. Can you describe what a typical day might have looked like for you?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I had breakfast with Senator Weicker almost every single morning that the Senate was in session at about seven o’clock. We would eat in the Senate cafeteria. He and I would go over the day’s likely agenda, although in the Senate the agenda is not ever determined by an individual Senator; it’s determined by the leadership. We’d be back up in the office by 7:30, quarter of 8:00, and I would go through paperwork, meet with different legislative aides that reported to me around different issues, depending on what was happening in the Senate at that time. </p>
          <p>When I first started, Ronald Reagan was President and the far right was making big moves to influence the U.S. social agenda, particularly Jesse Helms and some others, and Senator Weicker had a very different opinion about what the Constitution meant than those folks did, and so he asked me early on to spend a couple of hours every single day over on the Senate floor just observing. I would sit back in the rows and sort of watch the parliamentary procedure, try to absorb it so that we could be better equipped if we had to raise points of order or fight them on procedure, so that I would be every bit as informed as Jesse Helms’ staff was. </p>
          <p>Steve Moore, who had taken Stan Twardy’s place as counsel, he and I would take turns every day going over and sitting on the Senate floor in the staff area for an hour or two at a time trying to learn. And as a result of that, I developed a very close working relationship with several Senate parliamentarians and wasn’t very shy about asking what points of order were and rules, and so I would often, when there would be a break in Senate activity, go sit in their offices and try to understand what had been happening.</p>
          <p>I’d work with the staff as well to make sure that if there was a speech that needed to be written, if there was a legislative policy paper that needed to be written, if there were talking points for something that he needed, we were always ready to go. I chaired the staff meetings for the personal office staff as well as for all the committee staff that he had, and so once a week, we would have a senior staff meeting with the staff director for the Small Business Committee, for the Appropriations subcommittees that he had staff on, for the Energy Committee, and for the Committee on Labor &amp; Health Human Services, and then our senior staff. My job was to coordinate all that legislative activity and make sure that all the committee folks knew what the personal office was doing and vice versa.</p>
          <p>I later described it in many different interviews that I had, that it was sort of like being the bionic octopus. I had my hands all over the legislative agenda, making sure that everyone was coordinated and that if Senator Weicker had a particular position, it was well researched, that we had documentation to back us up on anything that might be challenged, that sort of thing.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did you have a number of people then working for you? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Oh yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Aside from the staffers, but people who you could delegate things out to?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, we had a legislative staff of about eight people that we would divide up issues so one person would handle defense and foreign policy, somebody else was doing transportation, etc.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It just seems like keeping track of all these different things by yourself would’ve been a huge—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No. People reported in to me, so I like to always say I had about a one-inch knowledge of everything, and that the depth really lay with the people that were doing the substantive work. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>So, for example, before a vote or a bill was coming up and it was a new issue, we would set up some time, and whoever the subject expert was and myself and maybe the communications person, we’d sit together with Senator Weicker and talk to him about the pros and cons of an issue based on what the research had shown and then he would make a decision. Once he did, then we would make sure that all of the supporting documentation that we needed reflected whatever decision he made.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>These people who researched the papers that are now at UVA have pointed out that there are numerous papers that indicate staff recommendations. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Which you could check yes or no.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Yes or no, right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Was that atypical, do you think?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No. That was pretty standard across most Senate offices. The idea was to try to condense the issue into a one-page paper that would do an overview, provide both sides of the argument, and then based on the Senator’s voting record, make a recommendation about how he should vote on that particular issue, but that was very standard.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did Senator Weicker actively seek the recommendations and explore the thinking processes of his staff members in terms of getting to those recommendations?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>It depended on the issue. If it was an issue that he was already working on in the Senate—I was starting with his third term, so he’d already been there for 12 years and many issues just aren’t that new. They cycle through on a pretty regular basis, so for those kinds of things, we had a well-established position. He had voted many times. He really didn’t need much assistance or input. It was more for issues that were evolving, things that were new, things that were controversial, and again, we were dealing at least in the first couple of years I was there with a far-right agenda that was quite aggressive, and so we spent a lot of time thinking as a group, briefing him as a group and as individuals about how we could successfully combat some of the far right attempts to alter the Constitution.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Was there general unanimity on the staff on those issues, or would you say there was a range of opinion?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Generally, there was unanimity. There were probably a handful of issues where there was either a range or there was disagreement.</p>

          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I have my own sense of what those issues were that were the far right issues, but it would be very helpful if you would tell me what you see as those major issues that you were working on.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Certainly one of the most major was the separation of church and state. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>School prayer? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>School prayer was very large, and in fact, I have a photo or a drawing from Senator [John] Danforth, Senator [Howard] Baker, and Senate Weicker. That’s before they had TV in the Senate, so they had court reporters that would draw them. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s terrific. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>When he left the Senate, he gave that to me, so it’s quite valuable, actually. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And that was during the school prayer debate. That was 1984 and we won that one. So it was separation of church and state. It was lots of issues around busing, issues about a woman’s right to choose were very controversial. It was at the time where HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome] was just identified and it was portrayed as a homosexual disease and one that was fitting for those who practiced those kinds of behaviors. That was a very ugly, ugly time in the Senate, but we fought that.</p>
          <p>You know, we fought for equity, women’s equity in sports through the Grove City case and Title X, free speech, first amendment, lots of first amendment issues, and then we took on the War Powers Act, quite a lot as well, so a pretty full social agenda. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Were you also involved in the anti-apartheid?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Yes, I was very involved in the anti-apartheid. I worked on the first draft of that legislation with Senator [Edward M.] Kennedy and his staff. I missed Senator Weicker’s arrest because I was about nine months pregnant and he wouldn’t let me go out, but I was the one that stayed back so when they called to see if anybody would post bail that they would call me. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, really? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>It turned out they never called. They let him go on his own recognizance. The whole staff got to go watch him be arrested, but he was just worried about me. It was in the middle of winter and he was just worried that it might be not a good thing for me to be out. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s very nice. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I was pregnant with our first child, so— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So this is a huge number of very heady and important issues that you— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Right, but equally important—and I think this is the one thing that’s not really talked about a lot with Senator Weicker because he was such an national figure—equally important to him were the issues that mattered to Connecticut. He was a huge, huge advocate for Amtrak and kept funding going for that train system, which was vital to his state. When the Mianus Bridge collapsed near his hometown of Greenwich, we spent inordinate resources on trying to make sure that we got funds and repairs going as quickly as we could. </p>
          <p>Even though he had a national agenda and portfolio, he always remembered that he was Connecticut’s Senator first. So we spent a fair amount of time working on issues that really would improve the quality of life for the citizens of Connecticut. We did a lot of work on defense contracts and defense legislation because at the time we had both Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft, we had a large submarine base down in New London, we had the Coast Guard Academy outside New London, and so I would say that it was probably more of an 80 percent/20 percent mix, 80 percent being what really impacted the citizens of Connecticut. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And 20 percent being more national— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>But because what he did on the national front was so important, a lot of that got eclipsed. The other thing is, you know, I think another very important position he held was on the Appropriations Committee. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>So he was able to really work on a lot of projects and provide a lot of funding to the State of Connecticut for very valuable endeavors, everything from child development programs at Yale that were cutting edge and still are cutting edge that he started, to community health centers in the state. The first one ever was under his leadership. Again, we did a lot of work with small businesses in the State of Connecticut, etc.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So as his responsibilities proliferated, and I know they did grow substantially. How did this change the nature of your work specifically?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I just spent more hours in the office.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it wasn’t a difference in kind, you managed things largely in the same way? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>There were no new— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Every Senate office receives a budget based on population, so he and Senator [Christopher] Dodd received X amount of money to run their offices, and so we had a pretty finite number of people that we could hire. That budget had to cover the offices in Connecticut as well as the office in Washington, and then the way you added staff was seniority on committees. So, for example, he had a couple of people on Appropriations because he was so senior, same thing on Small Business. He had quite a large staff because he was chairman. </p>
          <p>All in all, you just can’t add people as the issues emerge or evolve. You sort of have to do with the group you have, and so we all, especially during the first few years, ’83, ’84, ’85, ’86, we all spent many, many nights all night working, and the Senate was often in to 11:00, 12:00, sometimes all night. The far right would do that on purpose to try to wear down those who had different points of view, and Senator Weicker was never one to not be there. He was so—I never left the Senate ever until the Senate bell rang the last time, so it might’ve been 3:00 in the morning when I went home, and I’d be back at 7:00 having breakfast with him.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You have to be young and hardy, don’t you? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Yes, young and hardy and silly. [laughter] No, it was— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They were very important years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>They were very important years, and I like to think we made—we didn’t win all, but we won enough battles to I think really keep our Constitution intact, which was our overall goal. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002611"></a>0:26:11</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker and the Constitution</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. I’d like to talk a little bit about the Constitution. I know Senator and Governor Weicker in many conversations he’s had with me has talked about the Constitution. Others that I’ve talked to have talked about his commitment to the Constitution, so that comes up over and over again. Can you give me your sense of what he meant by constitutionality? What specifically about the Constitution he wanted to protect? I mean, the Constitution’s clearly an incredibly complex document. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, I think he had studied the Constitution and believed it was an incredibly elegant document and really portrayed the hopes and dreams of our forefathers as they established our country. He was particularly interested in the first amendment pieces of the Constitution, but not just that. </p>
          <p>When I began working for him, there were many attempts to alter that Constitution, and he felt that would be wrong, so in a way, ironically, he’s probably one of the strictest constitutionalists that’s ever served because he believed in both the letter and the intent of the Constitution as protecting all Americans equally. He felt that when there was a disenfranchised group, be it people with disabilities, be it people with HIV/AIDS, be it poor and minority folks, that that was the one document that could protect their rights, and the Senate was the one institution within that document that could protect those rights, and because of the way the Senate was established where one Senator could stop certain things, could filibuster, etc., he took that extraordinarily seriously. </p>
          <p>I believe that for him, defending the Constitution, what he interpreted that to be was defending the rights of the most disenfranchised of American citizens and upholding that this was a nation of laws and not of men. That went back to his time in Watergate, that really it was the law that should prevail and not the whims of a President run amok, or his staff, and that we really needed to always revert to what the law said. He would’ve been a magnificent Supreme Court justice because he was so clear in his thinking about what the Constitution gave us was protection of everyone under the law and it was the ultimate protection for wrongdoing at the highest reaches of our federal government in the legislative, in the judicial, or in the executive branch. It happened to be the executive branch that he became most vocal about during Watergate and then later during the war powers debates as well. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So in terms of this commitment to the law, would you also say that he was trying to protect the separation of powers in the Constitution?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Oh, absolutely. Separation of powers was hugely important to him, as were all of the very specific elements of the Constitution as they pertained to the Senate, so in terms of advice and consent on presidential nominees, insofar as treaties were concerned, those were never a pro forma vote for him. They were always taken very seriously because the Constitution itself spelled out those unique duties for Senators.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And that’s how the War Powers Act also comes in, yes?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>The War Powers Act came in. That was clearly separation of powers.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. Over the Gulf War, in this case, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Oh, gosh, no. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No. Well, I mean, I’m sure that was the Gulf War, too. It was especially prominent during the invasion of Grenada.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, right. I’ve read about how he stood up.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And our deployment of troops in Lebanon. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>So he wasn’t in the Senate during the first Gulf War. That was the second President [George W.] Bush. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I’m sorry. Okay. I’ve gotten my dates wrong. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No. He’d already been defeated. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>The first Gulf War started in ’91 and he was— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Governor then.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>He was— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Governor. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Was he Governor? Yes, he was Governor. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, he was Governor, so he was still in office, but not in the Senate. Right. Of course there would be those who would want to argue that the Constitution, although a document of laws and not men, needs men to interpret all those different clauses, and that there are often conflicts.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And he would say that’s what the nine people across the street do. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Now, men and women—when he was there, men primarily—but in terms of interpreting the law, he would say that’s the position of the Court. In terms of enacting the law and creating the law, that was the position of the Senate and the House, but he was very clear that once the law was passed and signed by the President, the interpretation then went to the judicial branch and he fought hard to protect the judicial branch. He at one point was the chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations that funded the judiciary and was very, very intent on making sure that they had the funds and the resources to actually interpret law, not just at the Supreme Court level but at the appellate court levels as well. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Senator Weicker is very proud of his resistance to the increasing conservatism of the Republican Party. On which issues do you think he and the staff were most successful?</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003237"></a>0:32:37</p>
          <p class="c-header">Importance of separation of church and state</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I think our biggest victory during the Reagan administration was the defeat of the constitutional amendment on school prayer. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>The fact that he was working with some of the moderate Republicans and the Democrats and was able to defeat that was enormously important, and really I think was a turning point in their social agenda being pushed forward, so I would always look to his leadership in defeating that constitutional amendment as something that was hugely important.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Can we stay there for a just minute? Do you recall what some of the most effective strategies were in being able to get to that point?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I think making it an issue around separation of church and state rather than allowing it to by default become the school prayer issue, really looking at the historical negative impact of the involvement of a church in a government going back to the Middle Ages, frankly, even before, and really taking it out of the sound bite of school prayer. What’s wrong with a kid saying a prayer in school? You know, most kids pray in school before a test. It’s the silent prayer, but they’re all praying for that A— [laughter]</p>
          <p>So I think he very wisely moved that issue from just whether it was okay for the kid to say the Pledge of Allegiance and then some innocuous prayer to really looking at the historic impact of when church and state intermingle and the fact that our country was founded on the fact that religious persecution in Europe really drove many people to this country, and so reviving that historical context was incredibly useful in helping other Senators become more educated and giving them the courage, frankly, to stand up and say, “This is more than about my kid praying in school. This is far more complicated.” So I think that strategy early on was wise. </p>
          <p>I think one of the best moments in Senate history, and unfortunately it wasn’t recorded for television because we didn’t have television in those days, but during that time he received, as you can imagine, death threats very often, sometimes a couple of times a day, certainly several times a week, and so we had alerted the FBI. [Federal Bureau of Investigation] He didn’t have Secret Service, but we all were feeling the threat and the pressure of this because folks who felt the other way were quite vocal and quite willing to take possibly negative action, so there was a lot of tension as we were mounting up towards this vote. </p>
          <p>One day we were going through the mail and one of the correspondence folks came upstairs and said, “Well, you’re not going to believe this, but we just received a telegram from the devil,” and I went in to the Senator and I said, “Well, at least we know where the devil lives,” because Elmira, Illinois, was where the postmark on the telegram was. And so it was a very nasty and threatening telegram saying that if you persist in this, you will destroy our country, that you’re ungodly. “This is Satan and you’re coming to me soon,” and that sort of thing. It was quite something, and so because he’s Lowell Weicker, he went to the Senate floor with the telegram in his hand and asked for time and said, “I have good news and bad news.” “The bad news is that” you know, “I’ve now been portrayed as the devil by Satan himself. The good news is if we all give Elmira, Illinois, wide berth, we’re all going to be fine.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>So that was a moment of levity in a very tense time.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He seems absolutely masterful in terms of being able to find the principle that can resonate with a large number of people.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And you know, the good news for him is he’s consistent, because those principles are spelled out in the Constitution. It always goes back to that for him, so the separation of church and state was exactly how it’s described in the Constitution, not as whether or not there should be prayer in school, so he went back to that document he valued above everyone and found his strength in shaping the arguments there in that document and that was consistent throughout his career. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And what were the coalitions that he was able to form to carry out these fights?  Who were the most important people that he worked with to make this happen?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>It varied on the issue. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, let’s say on this particular— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>On school prayer, certainly in terms of Senators that were instrumental, I think that Senator John Danforth was huge because he was an Episcopalian minister and a Republican that was not nearly as liberal as Weicker, so I think bringing him on, given his clergical background, was very important. On that particular issue, the interest groups would have been the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union]—some of the church organizations came on board as wanting not to have their business layified, if you will, so there were coalitions of different church organizations. I’m not sure People for the American Way was around then, but if they were they would’ve been active in that debate as well. </p>
          <p>On the other side, it would’ve been the Conservative Coalition; it would’ve been some of those very, at the time, vocal evangelical preachers. Almost all of them got in trouble on their own merits later, but it would certainly be all those groups that valued first amendment kinds of things, primarily the ACLU. We had incredible scholars working with us on this issue, from Harvard and Yale and other places as well, really having— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Researching— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Researching, providing arguments, mobilizing colleagues around the country, that sort of thing. As acrimonious as it was at the time, it was also one of the more scholarly debates, and it was really, again, just thanks to Senator Danforth, who was, I think, just so vital in putting his own religion on the line as a defense. Senator Kennedy was very involved, obviously, and always a leader in everything we did, with rare, rare exception. </p>
          <p>It’s hard to imagine now. Part of the problem is we see the Senate as it acts now. In 1983-84 when these issues were being debated, even though they were acrimonious and deeply felt by all sides, it was a very civil place to debate. Howard Baker as the leader was very sure that the civility of the institution was maintained, and I always say the day he was no longer leader was the day that the Senate became uncivil because he understood the value of respect of one’s colleagues. So even though we would get hate mail and death threats, whenever we walked onto the Senate floor it was the most respectful place. And as irony would have it, seating in the Senate is based on seniority so you get to sort of pick where your seat is as you go up, and Senator Weicker, being a large man, a tall man, liked sitting on the end of a row so he could sort spread out his legs. So he was on the end of one row and the Senator next to him was Senator Jesse Helms. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>That’s his seat, and in those days, and still, when there was an issue where it was possible that a Senator might need a staff person, they had the big Senate chairs, but there’d be a small chair put next to it so a Senate staffer could be with their boss, and so I had the unlikely advantage of sitting between Weicker and Helms on almost every one of these debates. Again, Senator Helms, even though I never agreed with one thing that came out of that man’s mouth, he could not have been kinder or more civil to me as a person, as Senator Weicker was to his staff people. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You think that would not happen now in terms of the staff people?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>It doesn’t happen now, because I went back for a very short time when Senator Paul Wellstone was killed in a plane crash and I went in the same capacity for Senator Dean Barkley. That was in 2002 and the institution had changed so incredibly and dramatically that it was not at all the same place I’d worked.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s fascinating that you saw it with a break in time and are in a position to see it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I mean, I’d watched it. I still have many, many, many, many friends there, so I’d heard the stories, but actually sitting on the Senate floor— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And feeling the difference was something that’s almost indescribable, that it was even the same institution.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So just going back to the larger discussion, you’ve said school prayer was one of the issues that you think was most significant in terms of standing up to the emerging and growing Republican right. Are there other issues you’d put in that category?</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="004326"></a>0:43:26</p>
          <p class="c-header">Issue of a woman’s right to choose</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, certainly all of the many issues around choice and a woman’s right to choose, and we weren’t as successful on those, frankly. We tried to get exceptions to—federal funding was being denied for women to have a procedure that was legally permissible under the law. When federal funds were being tied by the right and not allowing that procedure to happen, we tried to get—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Excuse me, these are Medicare funds you’re talking about, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Medicare funds, but also any federal funds that were going to like a community health center or any other government-run health program. You know, there was an all-out ban on use of federal funds, so Senator Weicker and in those days Senator [Robert] Packwood and others would try to, with a lot of Democrat support, offer an amendment to make an exception if the life of the woman was endangered, that that could be an exception, or if incest or rape, and we won some and we lost some, it depended, but the arguments were very passionate and articulate on both sides and it was something— </p>
          <p>Ironically, he at that point was the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on Labor, Health &amp; Human Services, so the funding for those programs was in his bill and he often had to pull his bill down and not have it pass because of the social agenda of the right and go into a continuing resolution, which he hated doing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>But that was the way to protect the rights of women, in some cases, the rights of young girls who wanted to play sports along with their male counterparts. Sometimes it was around issues of busing and segregation, so it was always one of the bittersweet moments when he had to pull his own bill down and not have it go through, not have a freestanding Appropriations Subcommittee bill because of the social agenda of the right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. So Jesse Helms was the person who was most strongly involved in both anti-abortion and anti-busing.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>There were others. John East—I don’t know if you remember him. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I don’t. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>He was from North Carolina. He was in a wheelchair, really quite conservative. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Where was he from?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>North Carolina. Strom Thurmond. On issues around abortion, Senator Nickles of Oklahoma was very vocal, so there were a lot of them. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Work on the Americans with Disabilities Act</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. I know that throughout his time in the Senate that Weicker was deeply invested in educational issues for people with disabilities, and of course introduced the legislation for the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Yes. The first ADA. Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Which we know we’ve just had the 20th anniversary.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And he was just honored actually as the father of that bill.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m glad to hear that because on most of the news programs I was watching at the time, I never heard his name being mentioned.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No. In fact, there was a big ceremony at the Cannon Office Building a couple of weeks ago where he was honored.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Good, good. I’m delighted to hear that, actually. Do you see that focus on mainstreaming people with disabilities to be connected to the other positions that he took, or do you see these as somehow a separate set of issues?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No, it’s completely connected. Again, it was protecting and advocating for the rights of folks that had been disadvantaged, disenfranchised. He began working on those issues in the House, again, seeing it as a matter of equity, and as science evolved and we began to understand more about the abilities of people with so-called disabilities, the fact that they could be mainstreamed, whether it was in an educational setting or a sports setting thanks to Eunice Kennedy Shriver and Special Olympics, he began to be very forward thinking about the fact that these young people should have every opportunity and every advantage that any nondisabled person should have. And so, again, it was about equity and protecting the weakest among us, and it wasn’t just for people with disabilities. </p>
          <p>He also took on very strongly an advocacy for people with mental illness, and we actually put people undercover into mental institutions and did a very revealing exposé of how badly folks with mental illness were treated in this country, a report that garnered lots of national media attention.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So who were those people who were undercover? They weren’t members of his staff?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Oh, yes, they were members of our staff who went in.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I know Maureen Byrnes was pretty involved in some of those visits, and you were as well, weren’t you?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I went on some. I didn’t go undercover ever and Maureen didn’t either, but we had—I can’t remember his last name—Steve. He was a speechwriter.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Snider?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Snider. Steve Snider was more involved, and then somebody who’s now working as the deputy to the secretary of HHS, a gentleman named Mark Smolonsky went undercover and really found a lot of the information and it was really quite revealing about what was going on. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How would that happen? How would they go undercover? They would call a place and just say they’re interested—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>They went as either an orderly or a worker.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, they actually worked in these places?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Oh, yes. They went in and observed before all these news magazines came up and did it, so, no, they went and investigated. Sometimes we’d go in—people like Maureen and others would go in and look at case files, etc., but we actually had people, Mark Smolonsky especially, going in and doing investigative—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s fascinating. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>—and then we came out with a groundbreaking report about what some of the conditions were and it led to legislation that was passed rather easily—not easily, nothing’s ever that easy, but readily—for protection and advocacy of people with mental illness as well as protection and advocacy for people with mental retardation.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you see this as part of a wide-ranging civil rights agenda then? Would you say it’s tied to his larger commitment to blacks and women?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Yes, absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think you’ve already said this earlier in this interview when you said he saw the Constitution as creating equity across every category.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And his point of view was those who are well off, those who are well educated, those who had great jobs, didn’t need the Senate as much as those who didn’t have those things, so it was the undereducated or uneducated and the poor and women who, again, we’re talking a couple of decades ago, didn’t have many of those sort of positions of power that they have now, so it was always about everyone else. Those who have are doing just fine. It’s those who have not that we need to protect, and that’s what he saw as his job.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So he bucked a lot of people in his own party in taking those positions, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Ohhh. And they delighted in his defeat in 1988, believe me. It was his party who defeated him, if you look at the numbers. That razor-thin loss to [Joseph] Lieberman was Republicans who voted for Lieberman. They’d been waiting since Watergate. They’d been waiting since [Richard] Nixon. They never had anybody that was conservative enough to make them happy in subsequent races until Lieberman came along, so it was his own party who defeated him.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And Lieberman played the school prayer card, didn’t he?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Oh well, I’m not going to talk about Joe Lieberman. I can’t. I will not talk about Joe Lieberman. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m not really asking you to. In the time that you worked for Senator Weicker, do you remember conversations about his party affiliation and how that was playing out?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Oh, all the time, especially after he won in 1982 after Prescott Bush withdrew. There was lots of talk about why are you still a part of this party, why wouldn’t you switch over to either a Democrat or become Independent? And he always said, “I want my party, my Republican Party, to be one of a large tent. I don’t want it just to be the far right. I want others that feel welcome.” </p>
          <p>He felt that staying in the party could draw others to it, and he had great affection. We called it the “Gang of Six,” and there were some moderate Senators: Senator [Mark] Andrews of North Dakota, Senator [Charles “Mac”] Mathias of Maryland, Senator [Mark] Hatfield of Oregon, Senator Packwood of Oregon, Senator Weicker of Connecticut, and Senator [John] Chafee, God bless him, of Rhode Island. </p>
          <p>That was the Gang of Six, and they were a power broker, because if they could deliver six votes on an issue and the Democrats came with them, that became a pretty big power base, so on a lot of these social issues and a lot of other kinds of things, they would get together and talk about if they could agree. They had a meeting about once every two weeks together in one of their offices. They’d sit around and sometimes staff were allowed and sometimes we weren’t, and talk about strategies and big issues and could they deliver a block of votes. Oh, the other one is Senator [Robert] Stafford of Vermont. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Stafford. Okay, so— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Yes, Packwood wasn’t really part of it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s seven. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>He was a good vote, but he didn’t participate.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He wasn’t part of your Gang.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No, he wasn’t part of the Gang. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="005423"></a>0:54:23</p>
          <p class="c-header">Engagement with Cuba</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’d like you to talk a little bit about your engagement with issues in Cuba because I know that you actually went to Cuba and brought some women back from Cuba. Could you talk about that situation?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Sure. Senator Weicker was and probably still is the Senate’s only aquanaut.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, I had a wonderful conversation with Bob Wicklund.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>He’s a proficient diver, and his point of view on Cuba was that it’s sitting 90 miles off our shore. Every other country in the world is there. The Brits are there. The French are there. The Canadians go there. It’s us, after this Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis fiasco; we’re not in the game. His belief was that the Cuban people, not the government, but the Cuban people, had a great affinity for the American way of life and for folk heroes like Abraham Lincoln, etc. </p>
          <p>He went, at least while I was there, twice to visit [Fidel] Castro, and they dove together. They went scuba diving together, and during the course of the trip in 1983—before he went, he was always briefed by the State Department and told if he can get a conversation with Castro, these are some of the things we’d like you to bring up and ask for. He wasn’t a diplomat per se, but he had an audience. There were six American prisoners at that time that we knew of in Cuba, three young men who had been out sailing and had crossed into Cuban waters and were accused of drug smuggling, which is what the standard accusation was, and so he asked Castro if he would release the prisoners. He said he would release the girls, and so he actually came back to the states. </p>
          <p>I was skiing in Colorado and got a call. Actually, the ski patrol came and found me and asked me to come down to the base, so I thought someone had died. He asked me if I could get on a flight and come back to Washington right away and would I go down and bring the girls back because I spoke Spanish. </p>
          <p>And so I worked with the State Department and the Commerce Department to get the permissions to go. Meanwhile, we double-checked with the Drug Enforcement Administration and others to make sure that these kids really were clean and didn’t have pending issues otherwise, which had already been worked out, but we went through that again. There was no federal or commercial aircraft that could fly to Cuba, so Senator Weicker asked one of his close friends to provide a jet. With the permission of the State Department we had that jet leave Palm Beach Airport. I was supposed to arrive in Cuba, be met with the girls, literally just get off the plane and not go into the airport, turn around and come right back and fly them to Key West where their families would be waiting, and that was all set up. </p>
          <p>We went through all the protocols. I had been briefed by the State Department, and when I got there, the equivalent of the Cuban Secretary of State met the plane and said, “We have a problem. You need to shut down this plane. You’re not going anywhere today and you can’t have the girls.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who shut down the plane?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>The Cuban government asked the pilot to shut the plane down and told me to leave the plane and that we couldn’t have the girls, and I’m 25 years old. I swear to God.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You were 25 when this was going on?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s amazing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And so I asked why we couldn’t have the girls and they said, “Because they’ve been hospitalized. You can’t have them. They can’t travel.” And this is all being conducted in Spanish. I said, “Why were they hospitalized?” and he said, “Because they’re drug addicts and they overdosed.” And I said, “Fine. I’ll go to the hospital to see them.” “No, you can’t leave the premises of the airport. You can’t. You can’t go to the hospital.”  “Well, let me talk to a doctor.” “You can’t talk to a doctor.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who was with you at this time? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No one. The two pilots and me. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh my.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>So I said, “I need to call Senator Weicker,” and they took me into what was their equivalent of a diplomatic waiting room, which was not much, and I said, “I need to call the States.” I swear to you, there was a red phone, [laughter] and they got me a line through. I talked to Weicker and he said, “Do not leave, first of all. You’re leaving today, and don’t leave without them. You get them on that plane somehow, some way. Figure it out.” I said, “How do you expect me to do that?” “I don’t know. You’re there. You figure it out. But don’t leave without them and do it today. I don’t want you spending the night. I don’t want you becoming a situation here. I don’t want a diplomatic incident where my staff person’s down there.” So to make a very long story short—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’d like to hear all the details. This is an amazing story.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I was able to finally talk to a doctor. He said that two of the girls actually could travel. One was questionable. They had taken drugs, but they weren’t illegal narcotics. Prison jails at that time and in probably other countries as well would give inmates barbiturates to sort of keep them down during the day and at night, and these girls who were 15 and 16 years old had been in jail for over a year, a Cuban prison, which was not a pretty place to be anyway. </p>
          <p>They had been told several times that they were going home only to be told that that was a joke or that that wasn’t the case, and they’re 15 years old, 16 years old. We have no embassy in Cuba, so the only way that they could get any sort of support was through the Swiss Embassy, where we did have a couple of U.S. diplomats stationed, and they would bring them things like soap and shampoo. So what started happening is that the girls were trading some of their soap and shampoos and things for some more of these drugs, and they had made a pact that if they were ever told they were going home again that they were just going to end it. So they were told they were going home and they tried to end it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Because they didn’t believe it. Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>They didn’t believe it anymore, and again, they were very young. And so I finally convinced the doctor at the hospital to bring the girls to the airport so we could do an evaluation. It’s only a 20-minute flight, really, from— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Cuba to Florida. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>—Havana to Key West, and so they brought them. I had never—and a very naïve upbringing—really been around anybody who had overdosed on a drug before and I realized the reason that the Cuban government didn’t want us to take the girls is because they looked quite battered. They looked bruised, which is something that goes with an overdose. They looked bad, and I don’t think they wanted them to arrive to the States looking bad. We did verify from the girls and from the government that they were not abused in jail except emotionally and psychologically, but certainly never physically abused. I don’t know where it came from, but I just hung tough and said, “We’re getting these girls on the plane and we’re going to go,” and as they were finally— this one girl was really in bad shape, I mean, she really was in bad shape. So I had radioed ahead with the pilots to have ambulances meet us at Key West.</p>
          <p>As I was getting on the plane, it occurred to me that they have had enough drugs to try to overdose the night before, but maybe they had other drugs with them as well, and I didn’t want to be arriving in Key West and then have drugs seized, so I asked one of the Cuban guards in Spanish to please go through all of their luggage and bring me anything that looked like a pill, anything. He came back about a half an hour later literally with a shoebox full of pills, all different kinds— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh my. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>—all prescribed by Cuban jail officials, and so we threw those out before we got on the plane and I was supposed to be back in the States at ten o’clock that morning. This was five o’clock, four o’clock at night, afternoon. Got the girls on the plane. The pilots took off. </p>
          <p>I went through some of their makeup kits and tried to do what I could with makeup, called ahead for the ambulances, got them safely to Key West, and we had instructions they couldn’t talk about the boys. We didn’t want to do anything to endanger the boys not being released, so these three lovely little girls had decided when they got back to the United States, if they ever did, they would kiss the ground like the Pope does. And so they get off the plane, I’m literally holding the one that’s in really bad shape, so she tries to kiss the ground. She can’t get up, so I have to physically pick her up. We had radioed the parents ahead of time what was going on. We had them put immediately into ambulances and taken off.</p>
          <p>And then, of course, the news media was sitting there wanting to know why our flight had been delayed, why we weren’t there at 10:00, had they been abused, and so I just made it up and said on national news that night that it’s standard operating procedure that when we have a situation where we don’t have diplomatic relations, we immediately take anyone who’s been released for a medical evaluation in this country and that’s where they’re going. And no, they had not been abused, and everything was fine. That was a long day.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What an amazing story that is.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>But it’s interesting. In the old days it was <span class="work-title">Life</span> magazine. I don’t know if you remember <span class="work-title">Life</span> magazine— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. I remember.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Always the back page was a big picture, and so the April edition of 1983 was actually me helping the little girl up from the ground.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. We will look for that for our Web site. That’s great. Thank you for telling me that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>It’s either March or April. I think it was April, but I don’t remember exactly. I didn’t keep it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh we’ll find it. You didn’t keep it? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No. I’m sure I had it somewhere. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you only had one conversation with Weicker during that time and the rest of it you just handled on your own?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I called him from the plane. When we were in the air, once we left Cuban airspace, I was able to call him and let him know we were on our way.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, sure. But the rest of it you just sort of—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Yes, and I asked him what I should be saying to the media and how to handle it, so he actually said let’s tell them this is standard operating procedure. Whether it is or not doesn’t matter. Just tell them that’s what we’re doing. Then once the girls were—the media thing was over, I talked to him again and he said to me as only he would, “I’ll see you at seven o’clock in the morning.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I said, “Would you do me one favor?” “Sure.” I said, “Will you call my husband and tell him to be at Dulles at 10:00?” We lived near Baltimore at the time. “If you could just do that one thing for me, because that would be great and that way—” He forgot, so I got to Dulles and nobody was waiting for me. I had to wait another hour or so until Mark came and I got home about midnight.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You didn’t have children at this time?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No, I didn’t have children. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, right. You said you were 25, so it was early on. Did you have other moments like this that are equally memorable? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, that’s pretty memorable. There were so many moments of sitting next to him in a hearing and him asking with so much respect for someone who was diseased or disabled about what their opinion was, or “I don’t care what the government—” Funding things. It was so many times with so much respect that he would reach out to someone and ask them to testify and ask what it felt like, just so many moments like that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Just watching the empathy.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>The empathy, certainly hearing the vote count on many of the things we thought we would lose and didn’t. I remember advising him to raise points of order because I got very proficient at parliamentary procedure and helping bring down huge pieces of legislation with one single point of order and having Howard Baker come up to me and say, “What are you doing here? You’re just ruining my whole agenda.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And putting holds on nominations of folks that we didn’t think needed to be there. The day that [Robert] Bork was defeated was a good day. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But learning these rules of parliamentary procedure, this was something you then just picked up after you got to the Senate?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>He asked me. He said, “This is going to be important to us, so learn it.” And I just became—most people don’t take the time and it’s very arcane and it was just one of those things I just fell in love with, so it was like a jigsaw puzzle all the time trying to figure out how you could move a piece and do something unique, and we won a lot of huge issues on points of order and parliamentary procedure because— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Is that a recommendation you would have for people today, to better understand that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Oh, absolutely. And when I went back to Barkley, because I knew it, we got some things done that ordinarily never could’ve been done, even though he was only there for six weeks.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="010827"></a>1:08:27</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s strengths</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So let me ask first the most important questions and then we’ll see what time we have remaining. As you look back over those years that you were involved, what do you see as Weicker’s greatest strengths that he brought to the job? Obviously, you’ve already talked about his commitment to the Constitution, his passion for these larger issues that have a clear connection in terms of values, but are there other things you could articulate?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Certainly his keen intellect. He is so incredibly bright and forward thinking and innovative, so he would often be thinking about issues that most people hadn’t even begun to imagine. It was his ability to use the Senate rules, to understand procedure and parliamentary maneuvering, and he didn’t ask me to do it. Well, he did ask me to do it, because he knew how to do it and he wanted people on his staff to know what he knew and to be thinking about that as well. He was, outside of Senator Robert C. Byrd and maybe Helms—Helms was also brilliant at parliamentary procedure. The three of them were by far the most studious of not just the Constitution but of Senate procedures and parliamentary rules, so his ability to use those rules, his ability to be forward thinking, his empathy, which was as big as he is at every level. And his courage. He didn’t back down if he felt it was the right thing to do, and he didn’t care if he was popular or unpopular. He stood up and said what needed to be said, and most of the time it wasn’t very popular.</p>
          <p>He forced a vote once on a HIV/AIDS issue that even Senator Kennedy left him on. It was 98-2 and he pushed his colleagues to vote and put folks with different sexual orientations into a very bad light and even his liberal Democratic friends thought that that was the wrong thing to do, but he felt so strongly that he wanted to be on record he did not believe that and he forced that vote. I’m sure Maureen [Byrnes] told you more about that than I can.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>She did talk about that at length. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And that was a sad but very important day for all of us.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Were there moments when he was hard to work for? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Oh, sure. He didn’t like people to make the same mistake twice and he at times could be a little short, a little temperamental. Not often. He was very generally kind to his staff and treated all of us like a family, and I think it’s a huge tribute to that that many of us are still so close after this many years. I mean, Maureen is one of my best friends to this day, and I don’t know if you talked to Terry Muilenburg, but Bob Dotchin and I, Stan and I, there’s this network of folks.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How did he do that? How did he create this sense of family? What were the mechanisms that made that happen?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I think it was he developed. First of all, he cared about us all. He and Claudia [Weicker], when my first child was born at five o’clock in the morning—he always got up around 5:00 in the morning, and my parents were in California, so I called the Weickers first, and they were at the hospital within half an hour to see our daughter. He cared deeply about all of us as people and still does, I mean, very, very loyal to us and we to him, but also I think it was the spirit that it was sort of us against the world in so many instances that we needed to be together and bond and to really take up these big fights which were not easy and they weren’t pretty. A lot of our colleagues in other Senate offices were quite cruel to us, and it was not a pleasant place sometimes to be because they disagreed, but we all felt that we were in it together. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Earlier you said the Senate was a pretty civil place.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>The Senators were very civil.  Once you walked on the Senate floor, it was completely civil, but at the staff level there was a lot of nastiness and backbiting.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Competition. People wanted to get their issues through, I’m sure.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Right, and we were seen as a very efficient and often successful band of—we had other friends in the Gang of Six offices, and others—I don’t want to overstate it, but I think it was just the sense that if we didn’t stand together and do this, no one would, and I think that’s one of the things that has just kept us all together. It’s quite unusual for a staff after this many years to be this tight.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I would think so, and this committed, too. The rest of your career has been committed to some of those same issues I would imagine, too, in many cases, some of the people I’ve talked with.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So how did you then stay involved with Weicker once you turned out those lights that last day? He went on to be Governor.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, first, no. He went on to start a nonprofit organization called Research America. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And I went with him to start it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Cindy Moore, who was his personal appointment secretary, and I and Cathy Miller went over and started this research organization and we were there for about, I don’t know, maybe a year and a half before he ran for Governor.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What did that organization seek to do?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Raise awareness and funds to augment biomedical research. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health &amp; Human Services, he was very involved with NIH [National Institutes of Health] and biomedical research, and I often tease him he should have been a doctor. When we’d go out there and he’d see the labs and the rats and he wanted to—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, he came from a pharmaceutical background. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And he loved it. He learned about these diseases, he got involved in these diseases and finding cures, and he loved medicine, loved it, loved it, and research, loved it. So we did that, and a lot of the folks that he had advocated on their behalf they wanted him to do this because he funded NIH before it was popular to fund it, and so there were a lot of folks in town that saw this need and wanted him to run it. Then he ran for Governor successfully and I wasn’t about to move to Connecticut because I had at that point my second child and we lived here, and so we separated for a little while. Then it was about 1992 and he was in the governorship and he called. We were still—I stood up for he and Claudia at their wedding. I’m personally very close to them as well as professionally. It wasn’t like I was ever out of touch with them. </p>
          <p>So he called me and said, “We just won the Olympics. We’re going to have the Olympics here in Connecticut,” and I said, “I think you’re dreaming. They’re going to be in Atlanta,” in 1996. He said, “No, no, it’s the Special Olympics. The Special Olympics are going to come.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>“We’re going to do the Special Olympics World Games and I want you to be my special assistant on this and make sure—I’m going to put a $20 million line of credit, but I don’t want the games to have to use the line of credit. So I want you to come and protect my backside on this stuff,” and I said, “I’m not going to commute.” He said, “Yes, you are.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He’s very persuasive.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>To make a long story short, I went to work for the ’95 games in Connecticut. I did commute. I stayed at the Governor’s residence when I commuted, so I would fly to Hartford on a Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning. I’d stay at the residence and drive down to New Haven every day, drive back to the residence, and then I would fly home on Thursday. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What were the ages of your children at that time?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Two and six. And I have an incredibly supportive husband. When I wasn’t working in Connecticut, I used offices over at Special Olympics, and I got to know Eunice Kennedy Shriver and Sargent Shriver and that movement very well, and so when the games were over they hired me to be the chief operating officer there. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And so because Special Olympics has always been so important to Governor Weicker/Senator Weicker, after Sonny [Weicker] was born he was very involved, and so it was a way to—I still communicated quite a lot with him about those issues, and I want to say for the record that he was heavily involved with issues with disability before Sonny was born. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, I know that. Others have said this too, and that’s very clear. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And in some ways Sonny was such a gift for him to understand the laws he had worked for so hard, and he has always thought of Sonny as probably his biggest gift in life, what he’s taught all of us about life and about ability. </p>
          <p>So I stayed in touch with that, and then after a while I worked on one of the Shriver boy’s political campaigns. It didn’t go so well for him. </p>
          <p>Weicker asked me to staff Barkley for the two months he was going to be in the Senate because he was an Independent as Weicker had been an Independent, and he wanted somebody to hit the ground running on a parliamentary area, and then when he left the Senate, Weicker had started this with Maureen and others, Trust for America’s Health.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh wow. So you did stay involved all through these years?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I’ve been involved. Very little time haven’t I been actively either working for him or reporting to him. I report to him still. [laughter] Now I’m raising money for his library project.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He has that kind of draw. He’s a very, very strong and persuasive human being. Clearly, I know there are people who did not like working for him and probably left the staff at various points, and there was one negative editorial that I know I’ve seen. I can’t even remember who wrote that, but of a staff member who said about him that he got intensely involved in an issue, worked on it hard, then sort of transferred his allegiance to something else. Clearly, the record does not demonstrate that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, no, and anybody who actually understood the legislative process would understand that’s par for the course, because once you resolve an issue, you go on to the next one. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>So once you defeat a constitutional amendment on school prayer, there’s not another one pending— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>So you do need to move on.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But did you feel that people who worked for him needed to have a particular kind of toughness or commitment to issues that was not true across the board, or would it be your sense that most of the people who worked on his staff just really enjoyed that process? You’d be in a position to know.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>I don’t recall many people voluntarily leaving the staff unless they were being transferred or their spouses were moving. It was a wide mix of a lot of folks from Connecticut who understood the state, a lot of people that were experts on issues. We had very little turnover. I recall hardly any turnover, actually. I mean, there may have been disgruntled folks, but they don’t come rushing to my mind. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay, so every human being has strengths and weaknesses. Are there any weaknesses in this process that you were involved in with him in terms of the time in Congress that you think made it harder for him, harder for the issues to get through?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, I think the thing that’s his strength is also the weakness, in that he was nobody’s man but his, and so he didn’t care about being lauded by political Washington. He didn’t care about whether or not he had to own a tux and go to the White House for an event. That payoff wasn’t important to him, so what official Washington thought of him he could care less about. Those folks who want to be on the inside and going to all the right parties, we weren’t the ones that were invited. If folks wanted that kind of caché, you didn’t get it by working for Lowell Weicker. </p>
          <p>You did get a lot of labor union guys coming and thanking you and shaking your hand, and we also had—because of Watergate, he was probably one of the most ethical members of the Senate, so none of us at any level, even though the rules allowed it, were allowed to go to lunch and have it paid for or have a gift, anything like that. I mean that was just—he went above and beyond, and I know when he was defeated, he had been the first Republican ever in the state of Connecticut to get the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations] endorsement for the Senate. I had worked really hard to get that endorsement for him and was very tight with all the labor leaders in Washington, D.C. They actually asked him if they could give me a string of a pearls and he said no, it was over the gift rule. So, bless their hearts, each one of them went out and bought one pearl and had it strung together, which he said was okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, that’s lovely. What a great story that is. </p>
          <p>A hundred years from now what do you think are the issues that Lowell Weicker will be most remembered for as history gets written?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Again, it wasn’t during my tenure, but helping insure that this nation did not run amok under the leadership of Richard Nixon, that he contributed to reinforcing that we are a nation of laws and not of men. I think his role in Watergate as a Republican will be hugely important. I think that fighting the social agenda of the far right in the ’80s will be something. </p>
          <p>I think on a much probably smaller level, but equally important, will be his advocacy and passion for folks with disabilities and the fact that he changed the world, literally the world, in terms of education of a population that had been denied— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>—education and equal rights, and now it’s not just our country, it’s all over the world that these kids are mainstreamed. </p>
          <p>Certainly being the fiercest defender of the Constitution of the United States during his entire tenure of the Senate. I think those are the things. Certainly what he did as Governor was a whole different issue.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. One thing we haven’t talked about is his commitment to environmental issues. Were those issues that continued during your period of time?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, I would argue that he was probably not the most environmentally committed Senator that was there. He was incredibly committed around oceans, but his record on some other kinds of environmental concerns was probably more conservative. On the Energy Committee, I think he would believe in more oil and gas drilling.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He was involved in helping to create the Super Fund, right, after the Ixtoc spill? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>All of this business in the Gulf right now, I keep on thinking about that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Certainly his passion for the oceans and what they could bring to mankind was really unparalleled, but I’m not so sure about air and land conservation as much.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you see the transportation issues, the Amtrak issues?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>He loved transportation issues.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But that also could be tied, could it not, to environmental issues in terms of taking money away from building of highways and transferring it to rapid transit?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Right. He was a huge advocate of mass transit, rapid transit, not just for environmental reasons, but more for quality of life reasons for his constituents, but if you asked me to name the top ten environmental Senators of all time, he certainly wouldn’t be one of them. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He would not be one of them. I understand that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>With the exception of oceans.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No. Oceans were an absolute passion and I think they continue to be.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>They continue to be.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And because he really experienced life underwater.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Oh yeah, boy. I loved when he would go down to those deep dives, because he wouldn’t call me for a whole week. [laughter] It was so nice. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you could get something done.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And not have to hear from him at 6:30 every morning or 5:00 every morning. It got to the point when the phone rang in the morning Mark would just turn over and say, “It’s him. Just answer it.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This has been a really wonderful interview. Is there anything else you would like for the record to talk about that we haven’t gotten to today?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, this is a very small issue, and it’s really not that big a deal, but the other area he championed and that never gets talked about was treating the U.S. Territories as equal parts of the United States. He actually chaired the subcommittee that handled all the U.S. Territories, so whether it was Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands or American Samoa or Guam, he really was the Senator that made sure that those Governors got invited when the NGA [National Governors Association] would come to testify about what was going on in the trust territories, so that was through the Energy Committee. It’s a very small thing, but for those scholars who are looking at the relationship between the United States government and territories, I think it’s something that shouldn’t be just glossed over because there’s a pretty rich body of information there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. You’re the first person who’s actually raised that. So how would he do that? How would he make sure?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, first of all, there would be hearings around different issues. He’d first of all invite the Governors of the territories to come testify before the Energy Committee and give updates. Always the most visible issue was voting rights in Puerto Rico, but he helped place marine sanctuaries in the Virgin Islands. He made sure that Guam and American Samoa had whatever appropriations they needed to do things and not just be military bases out there, but to look at the quality of life of those citizens who lived, sort of far off and far away, but were they getting services? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>That sort of thing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you think the motivation for that is the same as the motivation of looking at the larger equity issue?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Right. We have the 50 states, but we have these other— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And most of the reasons we have these territories is for military reasons, to help defend.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>So if they’re going to defend us, we need to defend them, and so it was sort of this whole mentality about making sure—other people weren’t thinking about that, but he would think about that, what was the quality of life for somebody on Guam. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>And, again, it’s a very narrow little thing and it doesn’t get talked about much, but it was something that I always admired him for.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure, absolutely. Okay. I think this will end our interview for today. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>My pleasure. If you have any other questions or you want to follow up—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I may need to come back at some point, depending upon conversations with other people, and I appreciate this very much. Thank you. </p>
          <p>[The conversation continues with Elliott recommending other people to be interviewed]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Again, if I can just make a pitch for Senator Inouye, I mean before these people are gone from us.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And who else? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Well, Byrd would have been somebody who would have been magnificent. Kennedy’s gone, unfortunately. They were so close. Somebody should talk to Chris Dodd, for sure. It’s narrow. It’s not as broad. Inouye and Dodd have the big spectrum, and Kennedy would’ve been the best person out there and Stafford is dead and Mathias is dead. Senator Hatfield if he’s still aware. He was starting to fail, so I don’t know if he’s aware or not. But certainly those colleagues would be important. Tom Harkin, for sure. They fought so many big fights together on behalf of the disabled.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are there people he actively worked against who would be interesting to talk to?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Who’s left? They’re all gone. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know. It’s really amazing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>Helms is gone. Thurmond’s gone. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So there’re really just a handful of people now that would be of value.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>To go back to the Senate days, somebody who’d be interesting to talk to because they had an adversarial relationship that turned into a very, very strong and positive one would be Dan Quayle. Senator [John] Tower’s gone. I’m just trying to think. [Ted] Stevens. Dan Quayle would be an interesting character to talk to.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He would be. We can’t talk to Nixon or Reagan. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">K. Elliott: </span>No, and you wouldn’t want to. And he wasn’t there with [William J.] Clinton.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, okay. Thank you again. I’m going to turn this off now. </p>
