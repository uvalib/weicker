          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is Phyllis Leffler and it is April 12, 2010. We are in the offices of Pullman &amp; Comley, in the office of H. William Shure, attorney and major staff person working with Lowell Weicker on the Watergate hearings from 1972 to 1974. Good morning, Sir.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Good morning. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you for doing this. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Not a problem. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I wonder if you could just begin by telling us a little bit about your own background and the circumstances under which you came to work with Lowell Weicker. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, I’m originally from New Haven. I was born there. I attended Dartmouth College and University of Virginia Law School. I was graduated from law school in 1964. In January of 1965 I entered the Air Force. I was a Judge Advocate in the United States Air Force from January ’65 until December ’67. </p>
            <p>When I returned to New Haven I joined the law firm of Sachs, Sachs, Giaimo, and Sachs. The Giaimo in the Sachs, Sachs, Giaimo, and Sachs was Robert N. Giaimo, who was then the congressman from our district, and had been for some time, and continued to be for some time thereafter. At the time, I was a Republican. Lowell Weicker was in Congress for his first term and had contemplated running for the Senate. Bob Giaimo, who was a dear friend, suggested that I meet Weicker because he felt that Weicker was a real solid person, notwithstanding the fact that Bob was a Democrat and Weicker was a Republican. And so Bob introduced me to Weicker. I worked on his first Senate campaign in 1970. I was his representative in the 3rd Congressional District. After he was elected he appointed me as his representative, local rep, for the 3rd Congressional District. </p>
            <p class="timestamp"><a name="000209"></a>0:02:09</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker hires Shure as attorney for the Watergate Committee</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I did that for a while. I didn’t do it for long. It really conflicted to a great extent with my practice of law, which I was just restarting. I maybe did it for a couple years, but he and I stayed in touch, and he once said to me, “Would you ever do anything for me on a full-time basis?” So I said if something really interesting and exciting came along I might be interested. And so when he got appointed as minority member of the Watergate Committee, he called me and asked me if I’d be interested in coming down as an attorney for the Committee. He was going to introduce me to Howard Baker. I discussed it with my wife and I said sure. Came down, met Baker, and was appointed. I think I arrived on April 1, 1973. I was 33 years old at the time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you stayed until when?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Until October. I made a six-month commitment because I had to take a leave of absence from my law firm. I made a six-month commitment to do it and I stayed until mid- October of ’73.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And were you involved with the Senator and then Governor in other capacities after Watergate? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Oh yes. I’ve got to try and think now. Let’s see. He ran in ’76. I was the campaign manager for his campaign in ’76. In ’82 I was his national finance chairman for his Senate campaign. I did not have a title in the ’88 campaign. Interestingly enough, I was in a very difficult position in that campaign because Joe Lieberman at the time was a very close personal friend. So I did not accept a title in that campaign. In ’90 I worked on his gubernatorial campaign and I did a lot of legal work for various departments while he was Governor. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So in the capacities after working on Watergate you were largely, it sounds like, involved in campaign—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Political, yes. Right. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I might have to come back and talk to you again in some subsequent time about that when we get to those papers. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>When you get to that time. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But in any case. In his autobiography, Maverick, Governor Weicker says that you were in effect, half Committee aide, half Weicker aide. And one of the things that really fascinated me about your role was how a person could do both of those jobs at the same time.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, I’m not sure that I would have defined it the same way. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>All right. </p>
            <p class="timestamp"><a name="000503"></a>0:05:03</p>
          <p class="c-header">Shure’s role with the Watergate Committee</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I functioned as his man on the Committee—each Senator basically had somebody that they recommended to the Committee. So my routine—first of all, I was fortunate that my wife let me go do this, and she stayed in New Haven so that I was able to work the number of hours that it required. Essentially what we normally did was I would get there very early in the morning, fulfill all my responsibilities as a minority counsel on the Committee, and then at the end of the day go to Weicker’s office, and we would spend time into the night rehashing what I had learned in my capacity as a minority counsel, which he was certainly privy to because he was a member of the Committee. I also participated in some of the activities that were taking place in his office by Searle Field and others. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. But the record of course states, and this is all public knowledge, that Weicker was named to the Select Committee in February and by March he began his own investigation.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, I’ve often wondered who defined it as an independent investigation. I’m not sure if he did. I think maybe the press did. He got actively involved in the investigation, and in the process of doing that he did some things ex parte of the Committee. I mean, he went out and sought out people who were critical witnesses and attempted to get their stories and felt that if they talked to him directly, without the Committee, outside the formal Committee setting, that he could get more information. He did it successfully with a couple people.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He did indeed. Did that cause tension? This notion that he was going on his own—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Initially there was tension. I think it was in early April when he declared that [Harry Robbins “H.R.”] Haldeman and [John] Ehrlichman should resign, and that caused a lot of tension. As I look back at that now, I was just a kid and suddenly I was approached by people representing the leadership on the Committee to say, “We need to talk to your guy,” or “We need to deal with this,” but eventually the tension abated. In fact, some of the key people on the Committee, key lawyers on the Committee, were very appreciative of what he was doing and wanted very much to piggyback on what he was doing. He was very cooperative with that. So it wasn’t like they were going in opposite directions or that they were going head-to-head against each other. He was supplementing to a great extent what the Committee was doing, and he was sharing it. It wasn’t like it was private stuff.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>There’s a bit of a suggestion in his autobiography too, and in things that other people have written, that especially Howard Baker was trying to soft-pedal things, at least at the beginning. It might have been [Richard] Nixon’s man, and that’s when Lowell Weicker started to be more insistent about who they needed to talk to, and also when he started going to the press early on, that this kind of blows things out of the water that otherwise might have been kept quiet. Do you see it that way?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, certainly I think going into the investigation Howard Baker legitimately believed that the White House was not involved in this break-in. I think that Weicker had a different view of some of the people involved in the White House and was more likely to question their roles in what was taking place. I have a lot of respect for Howard Baker. I did at the time and I still do. I truly believed that once Howard Baker realized what was transpiring, he did not take a protective view of the White House. If you wanted to learn anything from this process—in my 37 years since that summer it’s evident to me in a lot of instances that people have not learned the lesson. </p>
            <p>Most of the things that got the White House into trouble over the Watergate were things that were occurring during the investigation. If somebody had stepped up in June of 1972 and said these guys were off the base and they shouldn’t have done it, it was our money and we shouldn’t have done it, that would’ve been the end of it. It was the cover-up that really undermined the White House and undermined the government as far as the executive branch was concerned. What was hard for people to realize—so much of what happened that summer was happening—it’s not as though we were an investigation looking back and trying to determine what happened last year. We were trying to figure out what was happening yesterday. </p>
            <p>There were times when we’d sit around—I went to law school with Fred Fielding. He’s a very bright man, and he’s continued in the capacity through the second [George W.] Bush as a White House counsel. I would scratch my head and say, “What are they doing there?” I’m missing something because they’re too smart. So it’s not as though the investigation—we were a bunch of people who started out in April of ’73 and started investigating what happened in June of ’72. We were investigating what happened the day before. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And it kept evolving.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>And it kept evolving, and as it evolved I think Senator Baker became more aware of how treacherous the situation was, and people like Terry Lenzner and even Rufus Edmisten started to appreciate what Weicker was doing. And Terry particularly was appreciative and recognized Weicker’s value to the Committee, seized upon it, became a close friend of mine, and there was no tension as things evolved. People were grateful.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who was he working with? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Terry Lenzner was the deputy majority counsel. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I see.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>He has continued in Washington as a very prominent investigative attorney. And Terry had a couple of guys working for him, Scott Armstrong and Marc Lackritz. And those two, that team of three was in my view the most effective group of people on the Committee, and they were hardly at conflict with Weicker. They were very receptive to Weicker’s involvement and appreciative of Weicker’s role that he played on the Committee. See, I don’t separate Weicker’s—what people call his independent investigation. He was doing what he believed he was responsible to do as a member of the Committee, all right? The fact that he chose to use some of his staff people to help him do what he felt was his responsibility as a Committee member, that was up to him and he did that. So I never felt that I was ever caught in the middle of the Committee and Weicker with that. They were going in the same path. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you would actually question this notion that you worked half time for Fred Thompson and— </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes. I wouldn’t have defined it that way. I’m not saying he’s wrong, but I would not have defined it that way. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. Right. This is helpful. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes. I really thought—I always felt—I was there doing what I was supposed to do in terms of my responsibilities as an attorney for the Committee, and Weicker was one of the members of that Committee and he was doing what he was supposed to do. He was just— </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>If you could just talk about that process a little bit. Who would you say were the people you interacted with the most on a daily basis in terms of staff? </p>
            <p class="timestamp"><a name="001359"></a>0:13:59</p>
          <p class="c-header">Key staff contributors on Weicker’s Watergate Committee team</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, on the Weicker side, it was primarily Searle Field. Searle and I worked a great deal. I communicated back to Searle, and at the end of the day it was Searle, Weicker, and I, and for a period of time there was a fellow that we had hired from Ohio, [William] Wickens or something. But he was not, in my view, very effective in terms of his contribution, and he didn’t stay very long. But it was basically Searle and I on the Weicker office side, and on the Committee side it was Terry Lenzner and his group and the people I just named. I certainly worked with Fred Thompson. Fred and I got on very well. Rufus Edmisten, who was—as I said, everybody had somebody on the Committee. Fred was Baker’s man, Rufus was Senator [Sam] Ervin’s man.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did you have very different assumptions going into Watergate than the way things turned out?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Turned out? I don’t remember having any assumptions at the time, frankly. Let’s put it this way: Did I ever think that it was going to result in the President of the United States resigning from office? No. That was unprecedented. But I don’t think I had any assumptions going in as to what had taken place.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, of course. Right. But in terms of what the process would look like? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Had no idea. This was my—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Had never done this before—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Never done it before. You know, this was Weicker’s responding to my offer when he first was elected and he said, “What would you like to do with me?” I said, “If you get something that’s limited in duration and it’s exciting and interesting, call me up,” and he was a man of his word. He said he would, and he did. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course it wasn’t that limited. And you ended up not being able to stay the whole time. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Right, but I was there long enough. It was done. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you were there. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>We were basically done when I— </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You started in April.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>April first, and I stayed into the middle of October. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>By April 30 there had been this massive number of resignations. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>April was the dramatic month. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Was the big month. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes. April was, and then of course when we got—trying to remember when [Alexander] Butterfield testified, was it July or—did that open the whole thing up?  </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think it was June or July. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>June. I can’t remember if it was before Ehrlichman testified or after. Anyway—</p>
            <p class="timestamp"><a name="001639"></a>0:16:39</p>
          <p class="c-header">Shure’s participation in interviewing witnesses for Watergate hearings</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you had responsibility, according to the record that I have, for specifically interviewing people like Sally Harmony, Robert Reisner, John Mitchell. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I effectively participated in almost all of the staff interviews of witnesses. In that situation that was really—I can’t recall that every assistant counsel participated in most of the interviews, and I can’t say that I did all, but I certainly participated in most of them. That was something that Weicker wanted me to do. In that way I was able to convey to him what I was learning on an immediate basis so he didn’t have to wait for summaries that we prepared after these interviews. He had immediate access to information that helped him pursue the investigation in the way that he wanted to pursue it. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But to participate in—that doesn’t necessarily mean you would be the lead.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No. I was rarely the lead. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Even with Mitchell? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I don’t remember being the lead in those interviews. You had Sam Dash, you had Fred Thompson, you had Rufus Edmisten, you had Terry Lenzner. I was just an assistant minority counsel, but I was there and I was always offered the opportunity to ask questions, and I always did. But I can’t say that I led it. My memory is not clear, but you mention Sally Harmony and I remember the name. There may have been some minor players that I was asked—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>She was secretary to Gordon Liddy. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And that was early on. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>They may have said to me, “Bill, you take this interview.” There were times when two of us or three of us would interview somebody and they’d say, “Bill, you take this interview,” and I probably did. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why do you think that Senator Weicker was so successful in being able to extract information and create the public pressure for the investigation?  </p>

          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s integrity</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>You have to understand the man, all right? I remember after Haldeman testified it was a very dramatic moment because when we broke for lunch Haldeman sat at his table and stared at Lowell Weicker for a prolonged period of time. As were walking down the hall afterwards I looked at him and I said, “Are you afraid of anyone?” And his answer to me was, “My father and death.” </p>
            <p>The answer is that Weicker is an extraordinarily honest person. I’m not an apologist for him. Okay? He can be a difficult individual at times. But he is an extraordinarily honest person with the highest level of integrity, and I think people understood and learned that very quickly in the process of this proceeding. As a result, people realized that this was not a political ploy, this was really—he was outraged. He was sincerely, legitimately outraged, and I think people sensed that. And so they looked to him as an honest voice in what was at the time, and probably today is true as well, a great suspicion of the political system. </p>
            <p>There was a time when I actually roomed with him. I actually stayed in his apartment. But we would go out to dinner almost every night and we’d walk into restaurants, and the entire restaurant would break out into applause when we would walk in. And that’s the answer. I think people sensed his integrity and his honesty. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It seems from going over the record as best I can that there were numerous times when he had a great sense of how to use the press, of when to talk to people who release information, etcetera, which I would imagine would’ve been controversial at the time in terms of how he wanted the press to get involved and how you control that. </p>
            <p class="timestamp"><a name="002111"></a>0:21:11</p>
          <p class="c-header">Press leaks during Watergate hearings</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, yes. He was very, very astute at how to deal with the press, and he certainly enhanced the process of investigation on occasion by using the press as his vehicle to get the word out. If there was anything about my experience at Watergate that disturbed me terribly, it was that he had a press secretary who leaked. And he did it consistently in his effort to curry favor with major people in the press, and it proved to be embarrassing to me on occasion. There were times when I would open up the Washington Post and literally find my notes quoted verbatim from a staff interview from the day before. I had the habit of leaving my briefcase with all my notes in it in the office. I finally discovered what was happening. So there was some good and some not so good out of the press. I was not happy with this particular press person. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And how did Weicker feel about it?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I’m not sure how long it took him to really realize that it could have some negative effects. I think in some respects he used it a little bit to his advantage because he knew if he said to this guy, “Don’t tell a soul this,” that it was going to be in the paper the next day. But the answer was that yes, Weicker used the press very effectively in a lot of areas, and he was respected by the press. But if you want to talk about my conflicts, it was somewhat difficult for me to have information that I acquired as a member of staff of the Committee leaked by this guy in Weicker’s office. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And this had actual repercussions? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No. What’s anyone going to do? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Yes. It just wasn’t—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I’m not certain anyone knew that the source of the leak was my notes. But I knew. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. And did that press secretary continue to stay on?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I don’t think he lasted until the end, but he was there for a period of time. And he even had the nerve to write an article for some very right-wing newspaper magazine at some point. It talked about Sam Ervin sleeping during hearings, which was absolutely untrue, and said things that just weren’t accurate. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We’ll come back for other details, but on the subject of people who write newspaper articles later. I don’t know if you saw this article that came out by Richard McGowan.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes. I saw it. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In <span class="work-title">The Barnes Review</span>?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes, I saw that. I just made reference to it two minutes ago with you. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is the article you were talking about? Oh, ok. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes. And what’s unfortunate is that article was paraphrased in an article in <span class="work-title">Connecticut Magazine</span>. The only time I’d ever written a letter to the editor in my life I wrote a response to <span class="work-title">Connecticut Magazine</span> to Mr. McGowan’s portrayal of what transpired here during the Watergate investigation. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’d love to see that. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I don’t have it. If you go to <span class="work-title">Connecticut Magazine</span> I’m sure they can get it for you. There was an article by him and then a letter to the editor responding to it by me. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And do you remember when that would’ve been?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Maybe two years ago. What’s the date of the <span class="work-title">Barnes</span> article? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It says we accessed it on the 28th of May of 2009, but I think that’s after it was written. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I would think the <span class="work-title">Connecticut Magazine</span> article was probably in 2007 would be my guess. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, so pretty late— </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes, oh yes. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—in terms of retrospect, right. One of the things he says in that article that I found pretty astounding is he says that after 37 days Lowell Weicker lost interest in the whole thing. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>So your question as to how long he was on the Committee working for Weicker— maybe after 37 days he was no longer press secretary. I don’t remember his—you can just check the records as to how long he was press secretary. I would find anything that he wrote as the least credible with respect to the operations of the Committee and the manner in which the investigation was conducted. That’s all I can say. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Good. Okay. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>His article talks a great deal about what took place during the executive sessions of the Committee and staff, and he never attended those sessions. So how in the world he would know anything about them is beyond me. And I can tell you now, if there was any lasting impression, I have rarely met a man of greater stature than Sam Ervin. I can tell you unquestionably that I attended every one of those hearings except the third week in July when I was in Maine visiting my son in camp, and I never saw Sam Ervin fall asleep during a hearing. Never. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What specific moments during this process that you were involved in particularly stand out for you during this investigation? What were either the particular highs or lows during the time you—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, I alluded to the Haldeman testimony. That was probably one of the most dramatic moments I can remember, to this day. With Haldeman sitting there staring at Lowell Weicker.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So was that what made it so memorable? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Absolutely. Weicker’s father called him after that. [laughs] “Are you okay?” And I think the first day. I mean every day was a dramatic day.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The first day of the hearings?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>The first day of the hearings. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of the public hearings? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>The public hearings. Yes. That was something to see that room. Obviously, Butterfield’s testimony was dramatic. Probably the crowning moment for me was once the tapes were disclosed and when it started to be revealed what was on those tapes. I had written a paper for Weicker early on in the investigation—I can’t remember, it was sometime around when the hearings began. </p>
            <p>I wrote a scenario of what I thought had transpired based on what I had heard. I’m pretty certain of the date and told him in this article that July 23 was the dramatic date because that was the moment when Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and the President met and discussed how they were going to handle this thing, and that was going to be the smoking gun. That if they could ever find out—and when the tapes came out of course that was—I’m quite sure it was July 23, but I have the article, and whatever date I picked and whatever meeting it was, was the undoing of the President. It turned out that the tapes confirmed my speculation as to what had transpired. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So were you also still involved, if you went through October, for the famous Saturday night massacre?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No. I had just got just gotten back to New Haven when that happened, and interestingly enough, that happened on a Saturday night, and that Sunday morning I was the scheduled speaker for the monthly Sunday morning breakfast at my synagogue. So I walked into the synagogue with all that had transpired the night before and tried to be the expert without being a terribly good expert at it. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I’m sure you could’ve—I’m sure you knew a lot. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>And by that time nothing shocked me. </p>
            <p class="timestamp"><a name="003005"></a>0:30:05</p>
          <p class="c-header">John Dean’s role in Watergate</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, of course. Tell me about John Dean. How you view him, what you think. I know you can’t tell me why he behaved as he did, but just if you could talk about him—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, John Dean was an extremely personable kind of a guy. You meet him, you want to like him. I think he was about my age. I’d made a statement that made all the newspapers down there during the hearings saying that by the grace of God, go I. These guys were all young guys working for the President of the United States. I think John Dean was a pretty straight guy. I believed what he said and I think the tapes confirmed when he said. He, I thought, was a straight shooter and bright and very articulate. </p>
            <p> <span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Very early he came out and—</p>
            <p> <span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes, because he wanted to protect himself. And you know, let me tell you something; I don’t blame him for that. Why wouldn’t he? Why should he take the fall? He wasn’t going to take the fall for somebody. And you know, it’s very difficult to put yourself in the position of advising the President of the United States and being drawn into something that is clearly wrong. As a 33- or 34-year-old young lawyer being able to step up and speak up, and he tried to stop something, and suddenly you become enmeshed in it, you become part of it. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>And at least he at some point, I believe he did—he at least was the first one to say to Nixon, “You’ve got a problem here. You’ve got a cancer that you better take care of or it’s going to spread.” And again, what I said earlier in view of the fact that everything we were investigating was happening while we were investigating. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>You know, probably if Nixon had heeded his advice, stepped out in front, and done something about it immediately, his presidency may have been saved. I don’t know. I’m not sure what you’re driving in terms of my questioning. Do I find him an amoral person?  Absolutely not. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No. I guess it’s that on April 6 of ’73 he began working directly with Watergate prosecutors, and on May 3 Senator Weicker says he “synopsized everything,” so he clearly had a private meeting by May 3 in which he—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Who did, Weicker?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Weicker, yes.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Oh, he did. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In which he talked openly about how he sees things going, and then of course in his public testimony he went on for hours—there’s something like a 250-page manuscript that he was reading from. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I was there. I was at Weicker’s apartment in Alexandria. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that must have been incredibly dramatic. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes, Searle and I were there. I don’t know if we sensed that as a great dramatic moment. I mean, it just confirmed what we thought was happening, was going on. But yes, Weicker—that’s part of this so-called independent investigation. Weicker was doing what he felt he should as a member of the Committee. He got ahold of his neighbor and said, “What the hell’s going on here?” And the guy told him. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, and according to the way this is written up in Lowell Weicker’s book, he talks about the relationship that he had with Dean because they were neighbors. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes, they became friends. There were three of them. There was Weicker, and Barry Goldwater Jr., and Dean. They lived in these apartments in Old Town Alexandria. Old Town I think it was called. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. So that set up something of an entrée, do you think? That he could reach out to him. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Oh, I’m sure that facilitated his ability to get Dean to come over and talk to him. Sure.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But it wasn’t the fundamental—I think probably John Dean felt he needed to tell somebody. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I don’t know what John Dean felt. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. As an attorney, you need to be very careful to—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No, but I think that the answer is if Howard Baker had asked John Dean the same questions, I think John Dean would’ve given the same answers. It was just that Weicker took it upon himself as a member of the Committee to go out and seek John Dean, who happened to be his neighbor, and ask the questions, and John Dean gave him the answers. That’s really what happened. I would be surprised if anyone else on the Committee had done that, and no one else did. I mean, understand, no other Senator assumed an independent role of talking to people. They very much relied on the Committee staff to do the investigation and to report back. Weicker took it upon himself to do it himself, and that was the result. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You talked about the most memorable moment for you, which was Haldeman’s testimony. What would you say were the most difficult moments in your work? Aside from the press leaks, which you’ve already talked about. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>In the work itself? I don’t have any recollection of difficult moments. Hard work, you know, long hours. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You didn’t feel there were people who were trying to undercut the investigation. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I didn’t have any of that kind of nonsense going on, at least in my instance. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, that’s good. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I got along with everyone on the Committee. I got along with everyone on Weicker’s staff, well almost. It went that way.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you want to talk about the people on Weicker’s staff you didn’t get along with, or— </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I already did. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, ok. I understand. Let’s see, what else do I want to ask you here? We’ve been over a lot of these questions very quickly that we sent out early on.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>That’s okay. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But let’s see. Let me just ask you, looking back on this after all these years, what do you think this whole period of time meant for you personally and for Weicker in terms of his own career?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, from Weicker’s standpoint it was a huge boost in his career. He got a national recognition that he didn’t have previously. He became enormously popular in the state of Connecticut. Notwithstanding the 1988 election, he was highly regarded and he was elected Governor. I should say that his courage during his term as Governor probably resulted in the state of Connecticut managing to become financially solvent since then by insisting an income tax that was long overdue. And that no one else would have had the courage to stand up and fight for. So from his standpoint, that was a launching pad for his career. It was clearly the launching pad. Up until that time he was a junior Senator from Connecticut. From that point on, he was Lowell Weicker. </p>
            <p>From my standpoint, it was somewhat difficult to go back to the practice of law after it was over for me and to get back to the mundane aspects of the practice of law. But I would be less than honest to say—it certainly was a boost in my ability to make a living. It certainly enhanced my reputation locally. There were nice things said about me professionally, so my standing as an attorney was enhanced by that. But you’ve got to keep in mind the fact that I got out of law school in 1964 and spent three years in the Air Force. I wasn’t out very long when I was down in Washington. So from my standpoint, my association with Lowell Weicker, whether it was through Watergate or the other roles that I played, people always associated me with him. Certainly it was a value to me in my professional life. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s legacy</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you think that Watergate will be Lowell Weicker’s most lasting legacy?  </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>As a U.S. Senator? Yes. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He was involved in a lot of other things. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>He was involved in lots of wonderful things. You know, one of the things that I always say about Lowell Weicker is that he was always on the right side of the issues. His work with the disadvantaged is legendary. Here are things that he’s done that are wonderful. I’ve already alluded to the importance he placed in his role as Governor of Connecticut. But I can’t imagine that anything will surpass the notoriety of Watergate. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The notoriety for sure. I just interviewed last week Bob Wicklund on issues of the oceans and the environment and issues related to pollution and waterways. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I don’t know Mr. Wicklund, and I wasn’t involved in those things. But I can tell you that he was a wonderful person in terms of all the issues that were important to me. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Issues of school, school busing, school prayer, and transportation. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Everything. I remember his outrage as to what happened at Kent State. There were so many things that he did that were so good, and all the reasons why he supported [Barack] Obama in 2008, and why I’m a Democrat now. And you know I have utter admiration and appreciation for all the places that he’s come down on the issues. But will kids 25 years from now open up their history books and read about what he did for the oceans? I doubt it. Will they read about what he did about Watergate? Of course they will. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you know, I think that one of the reasons, frankly, that this oral history project takes on some larger meaning is that it really does give us an opportunity to talk with people who were involved in Watergate and in other issues. So we can put that into the record too. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Keep in mind the fact that Weicker was in Congress for 20 years. Two years in the House and 18 years in the Senate. Watergate took a year. Obviously he did a lot of things that people liked, because otherwise he wouldn’t have kept being re-elected. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It seems like it was also a time when people were still able to work across the aisle on issues. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, that’s absolutely the case. There’s no question about it. I don’t want to get into what’s happening today, but in those days you didn’t automatically vote against something because the other party supported it. It just wasn’t happening in those days. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, so he was able to make alliances with—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes. Don’t forget, it was a different political alignment in those days anyway. Barry Goldwater today would look like a liberal Republican. When I was a third-year law student contemplating voting for Lyndon Johnson or Barry Goldwater, you were afraid that the late Attila the Hun was running for President. Today we realize what a statesman Barry Goldwater was. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Were you also involved in some of the issues with Lowell Weicker related to his tax records? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No, I was not.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That came later. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I was never involved with that. I don’t even know when it came. I had no knowledge of it. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I think that was with Charles Colson, who served— </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, I saw your notes about that. You know, nothing would surprise me from Charles Colson, but I wasn’t aware of it. It certainly was never a problem. One thing you can say for Lowell Weicker is he’s as squeaky clean as could be. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I’m not questioning that. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No, I know you’re not. I’m just confirming it. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I was just wondering if you or others were involved in—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No. I don’t think I was aware of it until I read your notes before this session. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. And then the focus on campaign finance reform— </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Were you involved with any of those?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that was after your time as well. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And are you sorry that you left your position at all in October of ’73? I know you said you were only going to do a six-month commitment. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You never thought about staying on?  </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I couldn’t even think about it. I had two reasons. Number one, I had a job and I made a promise to my law firm. And number two, I had a wife and two children. Enough was enough. Summer was fine. My older son was in camp and my younger son and my wife would go to the beach during the summer. But they weren’t going to spend the winter.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What would you like me to know about this period that I haven’t asked so far? What do you think is important to say?    </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>In terms of Weicker? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Any of it. In terms of the period of time you were involved, in terms of—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Well, you know, it was an amazing period of time for this country. It proves the strength of our democracy that it could survive a prolonged attack on the executive branch of government. Because remember that as soon as the Senate finished, the House began. And so you virtually had a 16-month period that the executive branch of government was under constant attack. And yet somehow the country managed to continue to function. The President even was able to perform in situations that were very critical during that period of time. There was a war in the Middle East. It was awe-inspiring for the person like myself at that age to be in the middle of it all. I don’t think my father ever got over the fact that I was down there doing that. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It was very, very heady is some ways. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Of course it was. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you couldn’t possibly have known how the bombs would drop. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>You never knew. Yes. I’ve already said it repeatedly—we couldn’t possibly have known because much of what happened hadn’t happened when I got there. It started happening while I was there. It was also very hard to get back to the mundane practice when I came back to Connecticut. You know, that was probably the hardest part. I wasn’t exactly doing sophisticated law at that point. I was still an associate. I guess I was a partner, but not terribly—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Not quite as exciting as the— </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Reading about it in the newspaper every day. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Exactly. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What was Lowell Weicker like to work with day in and day out? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>He was better in the morning. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What do you mean by that?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>He got tired. He would get tired, and then you’d have to hone in on him to make him focus as the day would wear him down. They were long days. They were really long days. He and I got along very well. He could be a little volatile, as people know, but I was never the target of his volatility. Whether it was because he felt sorry for me or whether he respected my intelligence, or whatever it was. He’s a very clever guy and he knows how to use people. And he was effective.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Bob Wicklund, in the interview I did with him last week, talked about matters relating to environmental legislation and how lobbyists would be hounding him on one issue or another. And that there were times when he would feel empowered to say I know that my boss, Senator Weicker, will do such and such if you do such and such, knowing that he hadn’t really been given permission to say that, but feeling somehow that he was just going to be able to take the risk because of the relationship that had been established. Did you have moments like that?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No. I would never have. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It was really a different capacity. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes, it was totally different. Yes. I would never have presumed to speak for him. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I guess it’s— </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I would never play in any role, nor did he ever send me out to speak for him. I was his lawyer; there’s an attorney-client relationship. I was a lawyer for the Committee, he was a Committee member, and so it was not my role ever. I was his surrogate during campaigns. I would go out and speak for him, and probably most often it was to Jewish groups. I was very active in the New Haven Jewish community and federation. I was active nationally in the Jewish world and was somewhat known and became more known because of my affiliations with Weicker. So particularly in fundraising situations I was his surrogate, but I never spoke for him. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Were there things that he did in the course of the investigation, your being his attorney, that made it more difficult for you to do your work? </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I mean, we started out friends and we ended friends. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s pretty terrific, I think, given the tensions there must’ve been during these months, to be able to say that. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>The tension. Absolutely. There wasn’t a moment of problems or conflicts or anything in that nature whatsoever. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And did you feel like during the six months that you were involved that Watergate was his sole preoccupation, or was he able to— </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No, that was his sole preoccupation. Absolutely. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Because things happened so fast. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>He couldn’t possibly have done what he did and been able to concentrate on anything else. I don’t even remember what was going on in the Senate in those days, and I was there every day. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I guess that was what was going on in the Senate. I mean, once those hearings started being televised, people sat glued to their televisions all day long. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Not to mention you had seven Senators sitting there, so they weren’t going to the floor. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They weren’t doing other business. That’s true. Right. I’ve asked this question once. I’ll ask it again. Is there anything else you’d like to put on the record about this period of Watergate, or do you think we’ve covered it?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>No, I think we’ve covered it. There’s an awful lot that’s been written about it. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, Weicker, I’ll say this then, does mention you a couple of times in his book, saying you were like the number one person for him. He relied upon you, as you’ve already talked about, going to dinner with him on a very regular basis. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>I think that’s true. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So do you feel that there were ways in which you were able to lead him to particular kinds of questions?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Oh, of course. Absolutely. Go look in the files. I was talking with you before we started this session about my having gone to Charlottesville and finding in a group of file cabinets all of the original notes that we kept for each witness. You’ll see nothing but just all my notes. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You were just feeding questions. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>All the time. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. I know. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Or comments, or pointing out something, or bringing up things.</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And he regularly used them?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Regularly. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s great. So that’s your legacy to the Watergate. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Whatever. I don’t claim it. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, it sounds like you probably should. I guess just a last question. You’ve already said that you think Watergate will be remembered as the most important legacy of Weicker’s career—</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>You know, maybe we should rephrase that. It’ll be the event that he will be most remembered for. I’m not able to make a judgment as to the most important legacy he left. He was involved in a host of things, as you’ve already mentioned. It’s just my point being that it had so much notoriety, and he played such a prominent role in it, that when people talk about Lowell Weicker and look back on history, the first thing they’ll think about and talk about will be Watergate. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Now, maybe some brilliant historian will write a biography of him in 25 years and be able to say, looking back, this man made an enormous impact on areas that he should have been recognized for at the time, but now I know that. That may be true. But as of now, if you mention Lowell Weicker to somebody in Idaho, the first thing they’ll say to you is, “Oh, that’s the guy who was involved in Watergate.”</p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And do you believe that it was because of your involvement in Watergate, and getting to know him as you did, that you chose to stay involved in these other capacities later on? Is that fundamental in terms of that, do you think?</p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>That’s just part and parcel of the relationship. Can I predict that I still would’ve been involved with him if there had not been a Watergate? I probably would have been. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You probably would have. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Yes. We probably wouldn’t have been as close as we became. We were very close for seven months. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>You know, spent a lot of time together. Nobody envied me that. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Day in and day out. Okay. This summer at the University we will be going over some additional papers that will be cataloged and a lot of those do have to do with campaign matters, which we haven’t really tackled yet. So there will probably be a point at which I would like to come back and talk to you again. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>That’s fine. I was involved in three of his four senatorial campaigns. I like to claim that he didn’t win his fourth because I wasn’t involved. But I don’t think I had anything to do with it. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that will probably be another significant and important conversation. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>Fine. I don’t think it will be as lengthy as this one. But I’ll be happy to tell you whatever I know. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you very much for doing this. I really appreciate it. </p>
            <p><span class="interviewee">H.W. Shure: </span>My pleasure. </p>
