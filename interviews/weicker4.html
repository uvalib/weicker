          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. Today is May 14 and I’m at the home of Senator Lowell Weicker for the fourth of our interviews in the Lowell Weicker Oral History Project. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000025"></a>0:00:25</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s work on disabilities legislation </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Today we’re going to be talking about your role in legislation related to disabilities and mental health and also on the efforts to get more funding for research for the AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] epidemic, so my thought was perhaps we could start with the disabilities legislation. There’s a actually a fair amount of legislation even during the Nixon years that starts in the 1970s, and I know you were involved early in the ’70s in a vote to—[Interruption to check on power supply] </p>
          <p>In 1973, early on, you voted to override Nixon’s veto of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act, and you voted, I think, to override that because that act did not distinguish between money for the handicapped and money for other programs, and it all kind of got rolled together. Then later that year, Nixon signs the CETA, the Comprehensive Employment &amp; Training Act, which again consolidates many manpower programs together. You supported an amendment to increase funds for education for the handicapped. Then that gets rejected, etc. The point that I guess I’m trying to make is it’s very clear that you’re involved in these issues long before the early 1980s when you end up on the Subcommittee on the Handicapped, where you’re able to propose legislation.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I think where I really first became acquainted with the issue of the disabled was in Connecticut when I was in the state legislature, and John Dempsey, who was the Democratic Governor of the state, used the visibility of his office to highlight the plight of the disabled, both at Southbury Training School and Mansfield, which were the two state institutions for the disabled. I didn’t do any significant legislation at that time, but I was certainly impressed with these people as to the plight that they found themselves in through no fault of their own.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>When you say “these people,” you mean the people at the training school?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. In other words, the people who were called “disabled.” At that time, we called them “retarded.” Now, obviously, it’s no longer used. I guess the other word they use now is “challenged.” To me, it encompasses this whole—whatever word you want to use—constituency of mentally challenged people. I mention this because for all of us—I’m not limiting it to myself—I’m saying everybody in the United States rarely saw a disabled person. They were all warehoused in these institutions. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000639"></a>0:06:39</p>
          <p class="c-header">Eunice Shriver and the Special Olympics</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>John Dempsey used the occasion of the Christmas pageant and the televising thereof to bring the challenged into our homes in Connecticut to see them on television doing the pageant and it certainly was a very emotional event and one that opens your heart to their plight. I mention that because key to anything that went on then has to be focused on Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her Special Olympics. Once again, for the first time, people in the country came to know these young men and women, again, never having seen them and not understanding that given the opportunity they could do many wonderful things. </p>
          <p>This is really a good time also—I’m skipping in time—because I’m trying to lay the groundwork for everything that really ensued. This isn’t to be critical of the United States at that time, because indeed, even though we were oblivious of the plight of the retarded, we at least were starting to open doors and starting to make provision for them. The rest of the world was in total dark ages, but total. </p>
          <p>Here was an area where the United States certainly had a long way to go, but at least it started down that path. The rest of the world was no better off in the ’70s than it was in 1700. It was oblivious of their plight, and proof of that came when Claudia [Weicker] and I and the kids visited Europe and we went to the Winter Special Olympics in Salzburg. I think that was around 1990, somewhere in that area. That date can be supplied later, but it was around 1990, and it was amazing to see the residents of Salzburg literally standing in their doorways open-mouthed when they saw retarded people. They hadn’t seen them en masse before. They might have one person or two, but to see them all, and certainly doing their winter sports gig, I mean, it was absolutely amazing to see the surprise on their faces. </p>
          <p>Well, that’s why I’m saying that we were in that same position prior to Eunice creating the Special Olympics and bringing them all out of their institutions and into the light of day, and as those Olympics progressed and became larger, we as a nation accepted the fact that given the opportunity, the challenged could do everything we do. Maybe not as fast or not as smart, but they can go ahead and do it. And that was a real breakthrough, because don’t forget, laws are not going to be enacted unless you have a constituency to back them, and now for the first time it wasn’t just the parents of challenged kids that wanted laws and protection. It was the country as a whole saying this is the right thing to do, and so that was the game changer. </p>
          <p>To this day, I give credit to two people as to what’s happened in the United States. Number one, and foremost, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, and number two, Lowell Weicker, but I couldn’t have done my job if she hadn’t done her job first. Mine became easier to do because at that point in the game I don’t have to just talk to Ted Kennedy in the Senate. All my colleagues know full well who this constituency is. They’ve seen it, so this is a wonderful example as to how the country acts when confronted with a new situation or an old one that needs change.</p>
          <p>Once people saw the challenged, they were no longer afraid of them, and that’s a big part of this, because one of the things, I think, was that, “Retarded people are dangerous. They’re a menace to society.” Well, once you got over that hurdle, there was no reason why they should be locked up in an institution like criminals, and that made the push for deinstitutionalizing the challenged in this country and mainstreaming them in our communities. That background, I think, is just critical to understanding the metamorphosis that the nation underwent when it came to how it viewed and how it reacted to the disabled.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you also think that this emphasis on the disabled as a category follows upon lots of other civil rights legislation and is kind of like the next step in that process?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, you’re right. Semantically, you’re right. It was a next step, but it didn’t flow from the discrimination of skin color. It had nothing to do with that civil rights movement. It is a civil rights movement of its own. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>But it didn’t flow from the other one.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, but in some ways the country got more prepared for thinking about the civil rights of a particular class of people. Do you know what I mean? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I don’t think so. No, because I think that we all admit it, regardless of what section of the country we came from, that a black or a yellow or a brown person had the physical capacity to do anything that anybody else could do, the physical and mental capacity.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Or a woman.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Or a woman, on the gender side. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you think those are really quite separate. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think there’s something different. [Claudia Weicker and a dog enter briefly.] I think when a disabled person—like I said, that’s why it was different. The mentally challenged were looked upon as dangerous maybe. Okay? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Scary. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And maybe sick, and how would you know that that wasn’t contagious? Don’t forget, nobody had seen them because they were out of sight, out of mind, so there was a national ignorance applied to them. Well, we weren’t ignorant about black and white. We weren’t ignorant about men and women on that one, but we were certainly ignorant about this, so it was scary in that sense. I’m not saying it was scary, but that’s the way it appeared, in other words, to the average person on the street.</p>
          <p>So that’s why I give Eunice such a huge credit, and the whole Kennedy family, and I might add and it ought to be pointed out that their commitment as a family has continued. It wasn’t just Eunice; everybody in the family was involved in one aspect of this or another and continues to be to this day. It was a great legacy of the family, more particularly, I imagine, of Ted and Eunice’s sister.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I remember reading the obituaries when Eunice Kennedy died and her own sense that she was motivated in part to get into this because of her sister and the way in which she felt her sister had been warehoused as well. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, as you know, she was unfortunately the recipient of the way people were treated for this disability.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>A lobotomy. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>A lobotomy. Probably the thing that many people remember if they don’t remember that is the movie <span class="work-title">One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</span>, where that was performed. So that’s why I’m saying it was just terrific that they went ahead and made visible what none of us knew anything about. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001726"></a>0:17:26</p>
          <p class="c-header">The fight for funding for the disabled and the mentally ill</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That was the groundwork. That made it possible for Bob Stafford of Vermont to lead the fight for the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, and with the success of that, for Lowell Weicker to add onto it Birth to Three, as we understood that education should start literally at birth and go forward from there. It enabled the Vocational Rehabilitation Act. It enabled advocacy for the mentally ill, advocacy for the mentally retarded, and finally culminating in the Americans With Disability Act, so there’s a whole progression. There’s no point in singling one or another of these laws. </p>
          <p>These laws were put into place to go ahead and bring equality to this constituency. Maybe there’s another one out there that I’m not familiar with. Probably the last numerically large constituency, in other words, women were large, blacks were large, and the disabled are large. I’m sure there are other constituencies out there that maybe their civil rights are denied, but this was the last enormous constituency to have their civil rights recognized.</p>
          <p>Now, the problem today is not that we don’t understand this group, not really that any more laws are needed. I don’t think they are. The problem is that as we go ahead and follow this insane philosophy of no new taxes, the political subdivisions are going to have to find money to make all the popular things run, and so what they do is they pick on the less popular or less known things, i.e., you’re looking for money for education. So you need more money for higher ed. You need more money for K through 12. Lo and behold, there’s no more money because you haven’t raised taxes. The demands are greater in both those areas, so what do you do? You go rooting around to find an easy target. </p>
          <p>Who’s your easy target? The handicapped, who have just been empowered by the Education of All Handicapped Children Act and by Birth to Three, but, no, this is a group that consumes a lot of money, and therefore you’re going to go ahead and take the money from them to give it to the “normal” students, and that leaves, as you know—and as a matter of fact, one of the laws that’s been passed to make it all happen. But it leaves it to the parents to go ahead and use legal means to enforce the rights of their kids. </p>
          <p>Now, fortunately, we passed laws that will reimburse the parents. That was one of the laws that was enacted, but it’s a pain in the ass. To show the difference, so you have a kid. You put the kid in 1st or 2nd grade and the kid is denied an education. How would you like to have to go court to ensure the kid gets an education? I mean it’s wild. So in that sense, we still have a long way to go, and I notice where given any opportunity, the Supreme Court has, wherever they can, narrowed the vision of the Americans With Disabilities Act as to who it applies to.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, of course, my child has Down’s syndrome, but I don’t have the gall to stand up there and say, okay, that’s the definition of disabled. It’s not. My God, there are thousands of other conditions, some of them worse than Down’s syndrome, as to disability, so I’m not for narrowing the vision. I think we at that time made a statement that all of these are our charge and whatever the scenario that puts them into a disabled category, they should be taken care of.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002235"></a>0:22:35</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker champions disabled through congressional Committee work</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You’ve talked about the importance of making the disabled visible, but I’d love to hear you talk about the process within the United States Congress in terms of what you think was most effective, because there were multiple processes, right? There was what happened in Committee, what happened in terms of legislation.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I think that the process that was most important to me—I don’t want to generalize—is when I merged my role so that I sat both on the Authorizing Committee and on the Appropriations Committee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Weren’t you also on the Subcommittee on the Handicapped at that same time?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, I think so. But more importantly on, as I said, the Authorizing Committee of Health Education and then obviously Chair of the Subcommittee Appropriations on Health &amp; Education. When you do that and when you have a majority of votes on both committees, you can stop, number one, any incursions on your turf by people that disagree with you and you can make things happen as to the constituency that you’re trying to help. I think that was key, and with Senator Kennedy’s help and the conversion of Orrin Hatch, we managed to have the votes on the Authorizing Committee. Then, of course, I controlled the votes on the Appropriations Committee. In an institutional sense, that was really key to doing everything that we did.</p>
          <p>I don’t want to underestimate Orrin’s contribution because, let’s face it, he was a known conservative, and when he signed off on education for the disabled, that brought a lot of other conservatives along also, so I think maybe the conservative element within the Senate sort of felt, well, this is a good thing to do because it softens our image to the public. It was a good thing to do and it was the right thing to go ahead and do. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who would you say were your biggest allies in this fight? You said Kennedy. You said Orrin Hatch. Who else?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Bob Stafford, Mark Hatfield. I don’t want to be unfair, because there were a lot of nifty Senators out there that helped in the Senate, but I just can’t remember all the names.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Is [Henry] Waxman a name that you remember?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Sure. I know Henry Waxman because that’s the House side, but I’m not here to account, quite frankly. Henry has been in the forefront of a lot of health issues. Still is. But I’m not in a position to comment on what went on in the House. You don’t as a rule really get that close. You’ve got plenty to take care of on your own side of the Capitol. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002620"></a>0:26:20</p>
          <p class="c-header">Reagan administration undermines progress for disabled</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In your own book, <span class="work-title">Maverick</span>, you write, “In 1981 the Reagan administration did more to undermine than to promote the International Year of the Disabled, and there was no change in future years. It was a battle from beginning to end.” Why do you think Reagan was so disinterested?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>The first thing I suppose I have to do, and I’m sure a lot of people will disagree, is to disabuse everybody of a warm, fuzzy Ronald Reagan. I mean, hey, give the guy his due. Number one, he certainly could communicate. Number two, if he wants to take credit for the Berlin Wall coming down, I’m sure that’s something he can take credit for, but in terms of trying to tear apart the social safety net in this country, it was vicious, and fortunately, because moderate Republicans in conjunction with Democrats controlled the appropriations process, he didn’t get his way. Otherwise, we’d have had a mess on our hands and the people that he was putting into positions of authority were everything but. William Bennett as Education Secretary, please. This is a man who announced the fact, as did Reagan, they didn’t want to have a Department of Education, and he’s made Secretary of Education. It was that type of thing that really was of concern. I can’t remember all of his secretaries of education. I guess Terrel Bell.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002818"></a>0:28:18</p>
          <p class="c-header">Early advocacy for people with AIDS</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Wasn’t he opposed to having, I think on the AIDS side of the street, children with AIDS be able to enroll in school?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Could have very well been. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think that’s the— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>The best thing that ever happened to me in that regard—let’s face it, Reagan—I’m sure we’ll get into the AIDS thing secondarily, but to Reagan and to the conservatives, this was God’s judgment, in other words.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Reagan actually gave a speech to that effect— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yeah, well. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—that said something about “God will judge.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And he and Pat Robertson and all the rest of the evangelicals—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But that related to AIDS. It didn’t have anything to do with—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, but the problem was that it was wrong. This was a medical problem, a science problem. He and I had some differences, but God bless Everett Koop. He really rocked the Reagan administration when he came out with his views on AIDS and that really upset them. </p>
          <p>[Brief interruption, Claudia Weicker enters]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So, I also know that you authorized a number of people on your staff to tour facilities.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>One thought, by the way, talking about him. The point I was trying to make on the Senate floor as far as AIDS was concerned in education, the reason why I was such a huge advocate of sex education, it was the only tool you had against AIDS. There were no vaccines. There were no cures. There was no science-oriented solution. It was just good old-fashioned stuff that had been advocated for years, whether it was condoms or abstinence or anything else like that, and the problem was at the outset of AIDS—it’s not the case today—but at the outset, you got it, you’re dead. No second chance. No postponing. You’re dead. And that’s why it was so urgent on the Senate floor to get that point across. I know I’ve had several fights with Jesse Helms on that account. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Let’s wait to get into the AIDS stuff, because I want to stay—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>This is where the education and the AIDS come together. Eventually, the battle became, and still is, one of science. Back then it was strictly a matter of education. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So back for a moment to the legislation on the disabled. I know when I was talking with Maureen Byrnes she talked about the importance of making visits to something like 30 different mental institutions.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>The story was basically the same. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Was this something that you initiated in terms of doing these trips? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, because again, I wanted people to see it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So did they film it? What did they do?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>There were sections on film. Our investigation precipitated a lot of other obviously investigative journalism efforts.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So the goal there was just to get the information out into the public about the conditions in these places and, as you said, the warehousing of people.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh yes. The problem is, I bet if you went back in there today, you’d find the same abuses.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I’m sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>We don’t have the money to spend on anybody because we spend it on ourselves. I mean, when in the hell is somebody going to stand up and say the time has come in this country for us to one, cut spending; two, raise taxes and balance our budget so we can do the things that need to be done. [Weicker has lunch during interview]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We’re going in the opposite direction, if anything. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. Sooner or later there are going to be states when in both parties, if we’re to have a country left, they’re going to stand up and make that simple statement. Nothing complex about it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, you have to pay for services. If you want the quality of life, you have to pay for it. Somebody’s got to pay for it somehow.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I saw an article when I was in the doctor’s office yesterday when I was waiting for Claudia who was having a checkup. It was an old article in <span class="work-title">Newsweek</span>. Nine billion dollars to train the Afghan police force, and it’s totally blown up. They’re corrupt. There is no police force. Nine billion. Nine billion. No. I’m sorry on this count. I’m going to take the President to task, who I love. I don’t care whether it’s George [W.] Bush. I don’t care whether it’s Barack Obama. We’ve got too big an agenda right here at home to go wandering around Afghanistan and Iraq. [Interacts with dog, who wants food] You know, there’s just a huge job to still be done as far as disabilities is concerned, but I see people in the mainstream today who never would have even dreamed of being in the mainstream 30 years ago—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>On the disabilities issue?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, yes. I’m so heartened. I really am. I’m also proud of the fact that at least here in the United States we’ve made the strides we have on AIDS. Still haven’t got a cure. Most of it now, though, is drug related, needle use. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Let me just ask you one more question. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, go ahead. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It seems that one of the strategies in terms of dealing with disabilities was to redirect Medicaid funds from long-term institutional services to community and family-based services. You’re not remembering that? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Have you had your interview with John Doyle, by the way?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Not yet. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s critical to this section. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He’s the person who’ll—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. In fact, I was with John on this latest trip to Connecticut, and if you can believe it, to show you how things work, I did a program on Cox Cable. The moderator was a young disabled man. Hang on one minute. I want to show you this. </p>
          <p>[Interview breaks to view Weicker’s Cox Cable program recording] </p>
          <p>For the purpose of that [referring to the recording device] we just had an intermission because there was a program that I did that’s on my computer where the entire program, cameramen and the host, were all disabled, and to dream that that could happen 30 years ago—impossible. People would have said it can’t happen. It isn’t just Special Olympics. It’s young men and women doing a variety of tasks out there, which in the past they were deemed incapable of handling. What it says is they were never disabled by God, they were disabled by man, is really what we’re talking about.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. Is this one of the focal points you’re most proud of in your career?</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003940"></a>0:39:40</p>
          <p class="c-header">Importance of advocacy for NIH and NOAA in Weicker’s career</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, sure. There’s no question about that. I’d say it probably ranks at the top. The saving of the NIH [National Institutes of Health], saving of NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], at least temporarily. I rank these achievements even ahead of Watergate. Watergate to me was reactive. It was an attempt to save the Constitution. It was a tough but necessary piece of business, but these other things provide for a better life for a lot of people. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who were the staff people who you would say are the most important people on the disabilities issues? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>What, on disabled? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You mentioned John Doyle as one.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>John Doyle would be number one. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Maureen Byrnes, do you think? She was very involved in AIDS issues.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Maureen Byrnes, Kim Elliott. I’m trying to see if in my papers I have any reminders here. Boy, I don’t want to— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You don’t want to leave anyone out. </p>
          <p>L Weicker: —miss anybody because they haven’t probably gotten much credit, but—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I was just wondering if there was anyone that specifically took the lead over and over again on these, but it sounds like it was really a team effort.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Let me put it this way. You’re going to get the answer to your questions from John Doyle. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>He obviously knows the ones that worked on it. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="004123"></a>0:41:23</p>
          <p class="c-header">Advocacy for people with AIDS</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, okay. That’s great. So then let us move on to AIDS, because I think that’s the other major area that you really spoke up about.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>We’ve gone full circle, and I’ve told you how we got involved and the visibility of the constituents. </p>
          <p>[Interruption for equipment and a call] </p>
          <p>To round out the whole—there was a lack of any connection, and then we went through how the American people connected with the disabled, how the Congress then connected and passed the laws, how today life is far different than it was 30 years ago, and then the last thing that has to be said, though, since this is an oral history and I’m still alive, it’s up really now to the American people to preserve these gains, and they’re just as important for the disabled in this country as gains for women or gains for blacks. I’m sure that no woman I know in the United States, no black I know, wants to go back to, quote, “the good old days” or “the bad old days.” Well, neither do the disabled. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. And your efforts really moved that forward enormously.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>The program you saw, and there’s another program being put together because I think they’re celebrating the umpteenth anniversary of the ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act] this summer, so the work still goes on. I still involve myself. Whenever I’m asked to do anything with the disabled groups I’m happy to do it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What do you see as the new areas or the next frontier, in a sense, for working with the disabled and legislation that could support the disabled? What areas do you feel need—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You’ve got all the legislation you need. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s the funding. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It’s just a question of are you going to go ahead and fund the mandate, and that I can tell you right now is not happening. Any time a board of education anywhere can duck out of their legal obligation they’ll try it. I just think you have to see more and more of the success stories. </p>
          <p>Now, I will say also another thing, which I think is really important, because it’s great how we all love to beat up on corporate America and one thing or another, and I say “we all”; I don’t. Let me say that corporate America has been very, very responsive to creating job opportunities for the disabled in the United States. I think it’s a very exceptional performance on their part, and they ought to be commended. [Brief interruption]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are there specific corporations that you see as having been particularly involved?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>They’re just too numerous to mention, but I know that this is the case because obviously having a son who lives in a community setting with many other disabled young men and women, they all work all over the place.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are you familiar with BreadWorks here in Charlottesville?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You would like this place. This is a bakery in Charlottesville that’s a Work Source Enterprise.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>They hire the disabled?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They’ve been in existence for 15 years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>BreadWorks? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>BreadWorks. [details given about BreadWorks location] It’s a wonderful, wonderful place. In any case, did you feel badly that you weren’t in the Senate when the Americans for Disabilities Act passed? Was that hard for you? I would imagine it was.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, well. But there was worse to come. First of all, in the Republican Convention of 1988, I tried to have the Republican Party make a commitment to the Americans with Disabilities Act as a part of the Republican platform, and John Sununu on behalf of the President blocked that effort. And then during the campaign of ’88, I tried to accomplish the same thing in a different way by having George [H.W.] Bush personally commit to the ADA, which I think he did.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He did.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think otherwise I would’ve stayed aloof in associating with him, but he did. Now, I’m defeated, and usually a party takes care of its own. I had met with the President after my defeat, but there were no importunings to join the administration in any capacity that would be associated with an impact on the disabled, but I think the final insult came when Justin Dart was installed as the head of the Disabilities Council. Justin was a great guy. He’d spent his life fighting for the disabled. His wife, Yoshiko, is still alive. He’s not. In any event, I was invited to his installation, which was at the White House. Kim Elliott and I came up to the gate to be let in and we were told that I wasn’t on the guest list. I said, “Well, you ought to go ahead and check it out,” and they said, “No, we did.” The guards couldn’t have been nicer. I said, “Well, I guess that’s that.” </p>
          <p>I called Dan Quayle’s office because Dan and I always got along. I like him very much. And unfortunately he’d gone to the ceremony, so he wasn’t available. He called me right after the ceremony and he couldn’t have been more apologetic and apologized for the actions of Sununu in having blocked my attendance at that ceremony, so I have to say to you that I’m sure, probably with Orrin Hatch and others, they managed to persuade the President to get on board, but I still think that the credit belongs to a lot of people in the Senate and the House who went ahead and broke their backs to make it happen. I don’t care whether he was the President or whether he signed the bill, I’m not wildly enthusiastic about giving George Bush much credit for the ADA. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="005218"></a>0:52:18</p>
          <p class="c-header">Funding for AIDS research</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Let’s move on to the AIDS issues. What caused you personally to get so involved in fighting the fight for substantial funding for research for AIDS? Of all the issues that—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s a good question. The easy answer, I suppose, would be because of the death of Stew McKinney, who was a great friend of mine, who was a congressman from the 4th District of Connecticut and who was the first member of Congress to die from AIDS, but my interest preceded that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It did, yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think probably because of having been initially briefed or alerted by the NIH, probably by Tony Fauci at the NIH or NIAID [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases], which was his—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>His program that he oversaw? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>What do they call the different departments? It was the department that he was in. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Division. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>In any event, I suspect that’s where I first heard about it, and then, as you know, I come from a pharmaceutical background. My grandfather Weicker was educated at the University of Heidelberg. He came over to the United States to found the American branch of the Merck Company, and while he was here establishing Merck, he then founded in conjunction with a local pharmacist E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons, so that’s the background of my family. I’ve always been interested in science and what it is that industry can bring to the table, so the combination of that and my association with the National Institutes of Health probably led me into the AIDS area. </p>
          <p>And obviously, again, feeling that hearing all this moralizing really turned my stomach to the extent that never before in the history of the United States were you asked how did you get sick. If you’re sick—we take care of people in this country. We’ve always done that, no matter who you are, but here was the first time—well, it made a difference as to how you got sick. I can’t agree with that, and I didn’t agree with it. I think that obviously this was a very violent illness at the outset—still is—and help was needed, so I went about trying to do the best I could on the floor of the Senate, and it was clear that funding was critical to finding the solution to the medical mystery of AIDS. That’s where my real thrust was, to try to redirect more funding toward the NIH to do that job. Now, it’s true that no cure has been found, but that said, there have been substances that have—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Slowed down enormously the progress of the disease.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And clinically tested out that work to at least ameliorate the condition, among those, number one, being AZT [azidothymidine]. It’s still used today, and that came to pass because I was alerted to it by a group of gay activists who met with me one early morning in my office, and then I confirmed that with Tony Fauci and he said, yes, it did hold promise and needed its clinical trials, and so we got the money, I think $46 million, as I recall, to go ahead and move that forward. It proved to be the basis for even much of what’s used today in the form of what they call “cocktails,” mixing other drugs with AZT. </p>
          <p>I think one of the interesting stories that illustrates how deadly this was—I was offered a fundraiser in San Francisco by the gay men’s club there, which had a lot of very wealthy San Franciscans in it. They wanted to give me a fundraiser and I went out there, number one, for the fundraiser, but number two, my brother lived out there, so it gave me an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone at a time when I didn’t see much of my family except on something like this. </p>
          <p>In any event, within two years max—it might have been a shorter time than that—there was no more club. They were all dead. That just gives you an idea as to how virulent the AIDS was at that time, which is all the more reason as incident after incident came to pass for trying to get NIH to solve the problem. </p>
          <p>I remember Tony Fauci at the time telling me that it would probably take them until—they wouldn’t probably have a vaccine until 2000 or thereabouts, and I said, “Gee, that’s a long ways away.” Well, God, we haven’t even gotten one and we’re at the year 2010, and obviously the problem with the AIDS virus is it mutates and you think you’ve got it caught one minute and then it’s another form another minute, so whatever the case, I know it was my overall interest in science and medicine and that combined with the tragedy of what was happening all around us.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously, it was accelerated also by Stew McKinney. Stew McKinney was just a great guy. He was one of the few moderate Republicans left in the state of Connecticut. He was a big Lowell Weicker ally, just about the only ally I had politically in the state on the Republican side. There were rumors that Stewart had AIDS, but I never was able to confirm that. </p>
          <p>I remember a couple of times calling Stewart, and I didn’t want to ask the question directly, but he gave no indication that he had it, and then all of a sudden I get a call from his wife saying he’s in the hospital and he’s dying. I spent the last 24 hours of Stewart’s life with Lucie [McKinney]. So did Claudia, my wife. We were the three of us there in the hotel room and she was going back and forth and it’s pretty tough duty. I’m the first one to admit that by the time the vigil was over, I certainly wasn’t sober. To have to live through something like that, and never mind obviously the terrible strain that it put on his wife, but my job and Claudia’s job at that point was to try to at least console his wife and the kids. The kids were all terrific. Knew them all, knew the whole family. </p>
          <p>I’ll tell you what pissed me off was in the news article in <span class="work-title">The Washington Post</span>, they had “First Congressman Dies of AIDS,” and the whole article was how Stewart died of AIDS. Stewart McKinney was the greatest friend the District of Columbia ever had. He headed up the D.C. Committee, and a lot of people in Connecticut were mad at him because he spent so much time on D.C., but, boy, do I think <span class="work-title">The Washington Post</span> owed a headline, you know, “Champion of D.C. Dies of AIDS,” never mind just the AIDS part of it, and I love <span class="work-title">The Washington Post</span> and got along very well with the <span class="work-title">Post</span>. That’s one time when I was mad because he’d been such a great friend to the District in the work that he did. </p>
          <p>Obviously, that also further fired up efforts on behalf of the gay community, and then to hear Jesse Helms pontificate on the floor of the Senate along with the conservatives as to this horrible illness visited on people by their immoral acts, I mean, come on, just, you know, I’m not here to judge, I’m here to help. As you know, and I’m sure we’ll have a section on separation of church and state, my job is not to do God’s work. My job is to do what is needed to be done in the country whose democratic process I’m a part of. That’s my job, and I’m not going to put any other standard against that. Now, as it happens, I’m sure that quite frankly God probably more agrees with my viewpoint more than he does with Jesse Helms’s, but I can’t say that’s right or wrong. I do know it’s right as to going ahead and helping people medically during a time of great danger. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Both Jesse Helms and William Bennett just kept pushing for funds to be spent on mandatory testing, and you, on the other hand, kept on calling for more research and more education, so why do you think they were—I know you can’t put words in their mouths, but why did the debate take that shape of the issue of mandatory testing for AIDS?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I don’t know. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It was a way to identify people, to out people.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think they were trying to stigmatize people, and I just— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>For you, you just wanted to solve the problem. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, to me it was a problem to be solved. It’s as simple as that, and I get back to what I said when I used to get into my arguments on sex education. That’s the horrible part of this at that time; there was no second chance, and if we didn’t nail people before they had unsafe sex or before they put a needle in their arm, they’re dead. So again, I’d say that probably created the urgency within me to get to as many people as I could, and if you will read the rolls of that day in the United States—gosh, community after community, especially I’d say in the arts community— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I remember. Absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>—they were just being wiped out. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know, and pretty quickly.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>So yes. As I recall, one of the first times that the public as a whole got shocked was when Rock Hudson died of AIDS, because he was sort of Mr. Macho on the screen, and all of a sudden the guy’s dead of this disease that is in large measure a disease of the gay community. Not to say there aren’t other situations, and there were, you know, improper blood transfusions and all the rest that had created a problem, but that, I think, all of a sudden made the American people realize what was afoot here, that nobody was sacrosanct.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is another case in which Senator Ted Kennedy was a major ally and supporter.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>On AIDS? Oh, sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The two of you co-sponsored a very large bill, right, which I think was amended—the Public Health Service Act—so that there would be a comprehensive education program, information services, training, prevention, treatment, research, and the two of you were co-sponsors of that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And it probably didn’t pass.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I don’t know. It said it—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I can’t remember. You’ll have to ask John. Listen, Ted Kennedy when it came to matters—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, I think it did pass. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, that’s good. That’s great. But Ted Kennedy, let’s face it, when it came to health, the guy was just—nobody could beat him. He was there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So for you, this must have not been very popular it seems to me, because I remember those years and I remember there were lots of people who, like Jesse Helms, considered this part of the homosexual agenda and didn’t really feel that needle abusers and gay people should get a lot of extra support from the government. Do you feel like this had an impact on your future career in terms of your being so clear and direct?</p>

          <p class="c-header">Philosophy on taking stands on controversial issues</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. Look, I could answer the question two ways: Do I think that many of the stands that I took eventually added up to my defeat? Yes. Taken individually, people in Connecticut sort of shook their heads, but it didn’t move them to throw me out. But when, after a period of years, you add it all up, they finally said, “We’ve had enough of this. We want prayers in our school. We don’t like homosexuals.” Certainly there were those that, because I was very active in many civil rights measures on the floor, and as we know now, as you and I are talking and this is 2010, this is still a pretty racist country, so believe me, I’m sure that people didn’t like that. </p>
          <p>There were people that certainly didn’t like my opposing Ronald Reagan in the sense of denying him his anti-social victories. It all added up, and yet if you asked me, “Lowell, did you make a mistake on this?” No. I’d do each one of them all over again in spades, so I have no regret. I’m not sitting here whining about the consequence. I’m quite aware of the fact that most of America is not gay. I’m quite aware of the fact that most Americans consider themselves religious, that most of America wants to go walking around armed to the teeth with guns. I understand. You don’t have to give me a new poll. I think I understand the basic prejudices that exist in everybody, but on the other hand, the purpose of leadership is just that—to lead. </p>
          <p>And I’ve said to you, I know, in these interviews, I will say it again, when I talk to the young people at graduations or whenever I can, my last piece of advice to them is, “Listen. If I just leave you with one thought, it’s don’t be afraid to lose, because if you’re not afraid to lose, you’re the most dangerous man or woman on the field.” </p>
          <p>You’re standing for something and you’re trying to convince people to go in a proper direction, and I have to say to you in my career, I never was afraid of losing. I was never afraid of it. And when it came, I accepted it. Even though it was a narrow victory, I didn’t try to appeal the result or anything else like that. It’s a tough business, but nowadays, of course, everybody has to go ahead and find out how is this going to translate at the polls. I don’t care how it’s going to translate at the polls. I’m going to try and do the right thing, and in our system, and out of fairness to the American people, they have every right to say we don’t like it and you’re out. That’s fair enough. I can live with that, but then at least you don’t catch me in a fog out there. You know exactly where I am and what it is that I’ve done.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you think it played especially well with the Connecticut constituencies when Joe Lieberman showed up wearing protective gloves at a homeless shelter? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>[laughter] Yes, I remember that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Was that a political move, do you think, on his part?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I don’t know if it was political or not. I really don’t know why he did it, but obviously—I mean, this is the same Joe Lieberman also who took me to task for separation of church and state and said, “You should have prayers in school.” My God, if any faith has been the beneficiary of separation of church and state, I’d say it’s the Jewish faith in the United States of America from its inception, and I’m seeing somebody give me a lecture, in other words, on the fact that they should have prayers in school? My God, I don’t think so.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you don’t think it was just a political ploy that he used at that point, or you just don’t know?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Could have. I don’t know. I don’t know, and I don’t care, either. The idea is to have everybody unafraid in terms of the person that has AIDS. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That doesn’t mean to say unafraid of AIDS. No. You have to have safe sex and you certainly can’t exchange bodily fluids, all the things that—we know about how it happens, but shaking a person’s hand isn’t going to do anything.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. I was reading in <span class="work-title">The New York Times</span> just a few days ago about how the AIDS epidemic is just out of control in Africa. All these organizations that have been promoting drugs and prevention programs are so discouraged because it just feels like for every few people that they save, there are tens and hundreds of thousands more who are infected. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, it’s just brutal. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And the education piece of that is the piece that’s largely failed, because people are not really using protection. I don’t know, I think perhaps in the United States we’ve been more successful in the education piece, by and large. I don’t know the data on that, but it does feel like for all of the effort that’s been made to control AIDS in Africa, very, very little progress has been made.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It has not been successful.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s really been a failure. Right. So do you feel like— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>But you know, I got news for you. You’ll have to get the date from Claudia. When Claudia and I visited Israel sometime in the ’80s and I went to the Ezer Weiz-Weizmann Institute, which is their equivalent of NIH, and the guy that was the head of the Institute—Claudia remembers this—turned to us, he said, “AIDS will absolutely change the face of Africa.” This was back in the ’80s, and he told us that at that time, so he was well aware as to how the impact was going to go ahead and be. I don’t know all of the answers to it because I’m really not familiar with lifestyle in Africa and I don’t pretend to be, but clearly, they knew at the Weizmann Institute what the social habits or customs or anything else like that were to the point where they could predict what we’re now seeing. </p>
          <p>For example, does it have anything to do with why the Anglican community in Africa has split apart from the Anglican community in Great Britain and here in the United States on gay bishops? Maybe they know something that I don’t know about, but they’re violently opposed to any acknowledgment of gay as being anything but a sin, and maybe that’s the attitude they have to take in their environment, I don’t know, but it’s obviously a pretty complex problem, and certainly nothing’s been solved down there, that’s for sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you feel in the United States that we’ve got to a point where AIDS is not solved and under control?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You mean we can live with it?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, I do. I think with the exception of, obviously, needles, in terms of sexual conduct, I think that it goes on, but everybody understands its limitations and what’s safe and what’s not. My problem with it is that I think what worries the people at NIH is it mutates, and how do you know you’re not going to get a more virulent strain that all of a sudden kicks us back to where we were several decades ago? I don’t know the answer to that. I don’t have the scientific knowledge to know the answer to that. All I know is if that happened I’d be right back out there saying, “Well, you’ve got to do more research.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I don’t know where we are on that. Is there substantial money that’s still going into AIDS research?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That goes for AIDS? I don’t know. I certainly can get that answer for you from the Trust for America’s Health. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In assessing your own legacy, where do you feel your work on AIDS fits into these other issues that have been so important, like disabilities and NOAA and even Watergate?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, it’s very important. I mean, it just is. I think that what they don’t seem to understand in Washington these days is that, yes, there’s a great deal of power that attaches to the job of the United States Senator, but you don’t have to do anything for people that are leading a perfect, normal life. It’s the people that find themselves in trouble. They’re the ones that need your power.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But they’re often not the ones that get your vote, and that’s, I think, where you’re very unusual in your thinking about this.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, that may be. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And we’re seeing that more and more now.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="011830"></a>1:18:30</p>
          <p class="c-header">Working to defeat apartheid in South Africa</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>For instance, along with AIDS, another one that I consider a victory, I think blocking Reagan on prayers in school. I consider a huge victory apartheid, another one that I accomplished with Ted Kennedy, and my aide went to jail for a day. In Washington, if we as a country want to command global respect, how in God’s name can we be trafficking with a regime that literally legally says there’s a difference between a white man and a black man? This isn’t just laws that make a difference. Legally there’s a difference, and the idea that we brought the collapse—we didn’t. Obviously, [Nelson] Mandela and others that we were working with in Africa, but we certainly assisted the process of that regime falling and bringing an end to apartheid and bringing Nelson Mandela back as president. </p>
          <p>Shit, I loved my role in that. I truly did. I didn’t expect, quite frankly, in any manner, shape, or form, that that would be realized as quickly as it was. I don’t think anybody did. You’ve got to give credit to [P.W.] Botha himself along with Mandela, along with the fact that the United States of America overruled its President, our ambassador, a guy by the name of [Ryan] Crocker, who wanted to continue constructive engagement with the South Africans. We didn’t and we prevailed and that’s important.</p>
          <p>So the answer is that as I look back on my career, I had a lot of fun, too, doing these things. I mean, how would you like to wake up every morning and just sort of trudge off to the United States Senate. Go through the routine there, but when you’re actively involved in things that need doing, it’s an exciting place and a wonderful place. And that’s what I miss today. My God, would I love to get into the scrap in those chambers today with the people acting the way they are.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I really wish you could, because I really think your perspective, most importantly, your ability, your willingness to speak out and to find the right way to say it could really make a difference.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, you’re nice to say so. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, I think it’s true. I think statements that you made about issues related to AIDS when you said things like, “When was the last time we ever asked Americans how they got sick?” and I said this before in these interviews, that you seem to have the capacity to find a phrase that can really resonate and say something larger about the issue, and I don’t see anybody speaking out in a popular direction.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. No. Unfortunately, they’re not speaking out. That’s part of it. I even got my own executive director furious with me yesterday at the Trust for America’s Health because I insisted that we stand up there and really speak out, not in a pejorative way and not in a critical way of Republicans or whoever, or the Tea Party or whoever, but in a positive way of trying to explain what health care is all about, both the law and the need, and like anybody else that’s in the administrative side of Washington, whether it’s with the nonprofits or whatever, they like to play it a little safer and I don’t. I admit that, I don’t. I mean, just go out there and have fun and let the chips roll where they—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, you need a voice on the other side. There are people who are willing to speak out in ways that are so, from my perspective, clearly—incendiary. [laughter] We need a balancing act here, and we don’t have one at the moment, and everybody’s being very careful.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No, no we don’t. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In any case, okay. Well this is— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well listen, you have a good trip. In the meantime, I’ll get more thoughts together.</p>
          <p>Q: This is great. Thank you. </p>
