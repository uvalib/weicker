          <p>[During this interview, an oxygen tank periodically dispenses in the background]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is Phyllis Leffler speaking. The date is March 17, 2011. I’m in Hartford, Connecticut, at the Doyle Group, and this morning I will be speaking with William J. Cibes, Jr., who was the chief budget adviser for Lowell P. Weicker when he was Governor. This is all related to the Lowell Weicker Oral History Project at the University of Virginia. Good morning. Thank you for being here.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Good morning. My pleasure.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I thought I would start out by asking you to quickly give us some information about your own background and experience before you came to work with the Governor.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000048"></a>0:00:48</p>
          <p class="c-header">Political background of Cibes before joining Weicker’s administration </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Okay. I was born in Kansas, attended the University of Kansas, and went to graduate school at Princeton. Then came to teach at Connecticut College in 1969 and moved through the ranks there to full professor. Along about 1972 or so I was convinced, actually by a member of the city council, that you couldn’t teach politics, which was my field, without actually being involved in politics and learning from the ground up. Since I was a farm boy from Kansas, she told me that you’ve got to get involved in the urban scene if you’re going to be doing that kind of work, so I became active in the local Democratic Party. </p>
          <p>I contemplated running for the State representative in 1974, but in a deal concocted by my local ward chairman, was appointed to the local board of education instead of running for the State rep. When the State rep died in 1977 I ran and lost a special election but was elected in 1978 to a full term. I served in the House of Representatives in Connecticut for 12 years. Along the way I was deputy speaker, and when Rich Balducci became speaker in 1989, he appointed me as chair of the finance, revenue &amp; bonding committee. </p>
          <p>I had been active during this period of time while teaching at Connecticut College and also was involved in the State House, active in Governor Bill O’Neill’s campaign in 1986, and was involved with what he for a time persuaded everybody was going to be his re-election campaign in 1990. It became evident to me in the fall of 1989 that his heart was not in it and he probably would not run, so I began developing a campaign to run for Governor in the Democratic primary.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000312"></a>0:03:12</p>
          <p class="c-header">Cibes outspoken on support of Connecticut income tax</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>On the day he announced that he would not run I announced that I would, which threw a monkey wrench in the plans of the Democratic Party, I think, but I did it primarily on the grounds of the need to rationalize the state’s tax structure, which had been cobbled together over many years in the absence of a personal income tax. With my academic background and so forth I was persuaded that there needed to be that leg of the stool of the revenue structure, so despite my attempts to make it clear that this was only part of an overall program, I was certainly tagged with the idea that this guy was going to just institute an income tax. </p>
          <p>I did relatively well at the convention. I got enough to primary. I lost the primary, as you know, and was going back to teaching, and in late October or so I heard through the grapevine that if Lowell Weicker were elected Governor, he’d like me to be part of his administration, really third-hand, fourth-hand rumors. But right after the election, Tom D’Amore called and I met with the Governor and he asked what I’d like to do and I said, “I’d like to be secretary of OPM [Office of Policy and Management].” Well, he wasn’t quite sure about that because here was this income tax over there [laughs].</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Indeed. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>So I said, “Well, Governor, obviously, if I’m appointed I’d follow your direction.” You have to do that. He said, “But I think despite what you’ve said about the income tax, adopting an income tax would be like throwing gasoline on a fire.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know he said that, yes, on August 13, 1990. I have that in my notes here.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>[laughs] I said, “Despite that, I think it’s got to be part of the mix.” He said, “Well, maybe this is something we’re going to get into later,” but basically he said, “You’ve got to do what I — my aim is to cut as much as I can from the budget.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But let’s hold up on that for just a moment. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Tell me a little bit about your relationship with Tom D’Amore. I know from Lowell Weicker’s book that he’s published, called Maverick; he writes in that book that it was Tom D’Amore who recommended you to Weicker for this position, so I think that’s now part of the public record, since it’s in the book. [laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Well, that’s probably true. Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So how did you know and interact with Tom D’Amore?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>About at the same level I interacted with Lowell Weicker, which was to say not.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really? Interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I first met the Governor on the campaign trail marching in a parade in Tolland, and I think that may have been one of the few times I’d even talked with him on the campaign trail. I certainly had not been in contact with him before I was involved in the gubernatorial race. And I didn’t know Tom. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s interesting, because as a member of the Connecticut Legislature for all those years, one might have expected some interaction— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>One might have thought that. [laughs]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—with what was going on with the Senator from the state and his staff.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Well, that’s true, but it wasn’t in my case. Republicans and Democrats don’t get intimately involved in one another’s affairs. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I just didn’t know Tom at all. I’d known of his reputation, of course. He was chair of the Republican Party, but I think the first time that I can recall that I ever talked to Tom was after a gubernatorial debate sometime in the late spring/early summer of 1990. Connecticut being what it is, there was a series of debates, and at this particular one—I can’t even remember who sponsored it, but it was at the Farmington Marriott. The two Democratic candidates, Bruce Morris and myself and John Rowland and Governor Weicker and maybe one other, I can’t remember, but I know the four were there and all presented. </p>
          <p>As usual at that time, I made clear what my position was, that the state needed a revenue balance, and I continue to think that I’d argued persuasively. One never knows about these things, but afterwards, Tom came up to me, introduced himself, and said, “You know, Weicker is looking for a lieutenant gubernatorial candidate. Would you like to drop out of the Governor’s race and run as his Lieutenant governor alongside him?” I did not do that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that would’ve been on the Independent ticket?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes, the Connecticut Party. And I told him, no, I was committed to running and I thought that the positions I held needed to be completely aired, so I told him I didn’t want to do that. I guess later I heard that the Governor had been impressed at least with what I’d said, and I’m sure Tom would not have made that approach without the Governor’s— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>—approval, but that was about the only time that I talked with Tom.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s very interesting.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Later on, after I’d lost the primary, the fourth-hand rumor I’d heard that Weicker was interested in me joining the administration came through a mutual friend of John Doyle’s who had said that John had mentioned something about this and that’s how I was contacted there. </p>
          <p>On the day after the election, I’d written in response to a request from <span class="work-title">The Hartford Courant</span> an editorial piece about the election and made some comments about the fact that I thought everybody needed to pull together because the state was in a serious position. It was published on Sunday after the election. Tom called me from his car on the way back from the Cape after it had been published. He’d read it and said, “The Governor would like to meet with you,” so we arranged that. That happened at Eunice [Groark]’s house, I think, a couple of days after that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s Eunice Groark?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Eunice Groark, right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>My records say that the election took place on November 6 and on November 19 you are announced as Secretary of the Office of Public Management.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Office of Policy &amp; Management.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Policy and Management, thank you, which oversees the budget, so we’re talking about 13 days from election until that announcement, and obviously you were contacted before then— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—to talk about that, and that almost seems like that was one of his first— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It was.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Would that have been one of the first announcements?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It usually is in the gubernatorial administration. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay, all right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It certainly was this last time with Governor [Dannel] Malloy.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it strikes me that that’s gutsy on two levels: one, it’s gutsy of the Governor to bring in somebody who had already announced himself as being in favor of the income tax, even though I know that right from the start he said we’re not going to start off this way, but also on your part, because you’ve been associated as a Democrat, and by doing this, you’re supporting at least a long-term Republican who’s just become an Independent. Did that concern you at all?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It did not. It was gutsy on the part of the Governor. It was not gutsy on my part. I was in a position then and I guess sort of remain in the position now that I don’t come from wealth. I didn’t have a lot of money, and I needed to be sure that whatever happened and if I joined the administration I would be able to fall back to Connecticut College where I was a tenured professor. Once I was assured of that, I made arrangements with the college after the offer was made, and there was really no problem for me. Basically it was not gutsy to take a job that I might be fired from because I had the fallback of a tenured position at Connecticut College, and so in that respect, it was not gutsy. Also I guess I didn’t see it as a gutsy move to join an independent administration because I’d pretty much been rejected by the Democrats. </p>
          <p>I was convinced that the state could not continue with the revenue structure that it had, and I’d been adhering to that position for ten years. I admired the fact that the Governor and his campaign, while he’d made some cracks about throwing gasoline on a fire with an income tax—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And then six days later said that the income tax was not on the table.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>But he did not say it was off the table. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Off the table. Right. [laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I think all of us at that time were looking for those little nuances, and it was important to me that he had not taken that pledge. Politics being what it is, you look for those little nuances, and I was encouraged by the fact that he had not taken the income tax off the table and not made the pledge that he would never sign an income tax. And given the fact that the Democratic candidate, Bruce Morrison, had made it clear that he was not in support of an income tax, Governor Weicker was essentially the sole hope of ever moving forward in a direction that made sense for the state. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. All right. So perhaps we could now get into some of those deliberations and processes that actually led to the income tax. I’ve followed the record myself and I know that there was a period of about six months in terms of exploring this until ultimately the income tax got passed, but in those six months, there were a lot of storms along the way. Could you, from your perspective, describe that period of time?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I think the critical time was a period of about six weeks which was before Governor Weicker even mentioned it in his budget speech because that was the period of time that he really came to view the income tax as an essential part of a balanced revenue structure. As I’d spoken a little bit earlier, he’d said when he’d interviewed me, I guess he didn’t come out and ask me right then, but he wanted to know what I thought. He made it clear that he wanted, first, to look at reductions in state spending. If that absolutely failed to close the gap and there was a special circumstance, I guess, then is that—I think all of us on the inside of government knew that there was a huge deficit in terms of the 1991 budget and a bigger projected for 1992 that would be adopted in the spring of ’91, the fiscal year being as it is, but a lot of people didn’t believe that. </p>
          <p>Governor O’Neill in his announcements made efforts to minimize the deficit in the fall of 1990 as the election was approaching, but it was going to be a big deficit and it in fact got bigger. I think right before the election some people said it’s only a couple hundred million. I’d been saying in the campaign it was a billion. That was the number it turned out to be at the time, but by the time spring rolled around after the Governor’s budget was announced, it turned out that the overall shortfall in ’91 and the projected shortfall for ’92 was $3 billion, so it just got worse during this period of time. But to go back, he’d made it clear: “First of all, you look at budget reductions, and if that turns out not to be enough, then you can look at income, but you can’t look at the income tax. I don’t want you looking at the income tax until we’ve exhausted everything.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s well described in his book, too, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>[laughs] Well, it’s accurate. I think some people still don’t believe that’s the case, but it was. I’d been fortunate to be allowed into OPM [Office of Policy and Management]. I’d been on good relations with Governor O’Neill since I’d been involved in two of his campaigns at a fairly high level, and so the outgoing secretary made the office available to me. I was able to work with the budget analysts starting in early December actually. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>December of ’91?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>’90.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>December of ’90?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>’90.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Long before the Governor was inaugurated. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, right, of course.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>And I was able to build a great team of people, some of whom are still active in state government today, and they were incisive minds, great people, and so we also added a critical part, and that was a guy by the name of Charles Ward who had been on Weicker’s campaign team. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>W-A-R-D?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. Charles Ward, “Chip,” as he’s known. And the Governor stuck him in the revenue section just to make sure that everybody was honest over there. A brilliant, brilliant guy. Probably the smartest person I know. Chip was involved in working through the numbers and making sure that nobody—in fact, nobody looked at the revenue until Weicker said it was okay. [phone call] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Just carry on. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001940"></a>0:19:40</p>
          <p class="c-header">State sales tax and its role in the budget</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Chip was heavily involved in looking at the spending cuts as well. Once the Governor was ensconced in the capitol after he was inaugurated, we would traipse over to the office to make presentations about potential cuts, and the Governor would come over to OPM and look through the details. After a couple of weeks, by early January, he was convinced that we couldn’t close the gap through budget cuts alone. So he authorized us to look at revenue, and he particularly wanted us to look at sales taxes, to end some sales tax exemptions and potentially increase the sales tax rate.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Those would be exemptions on things like gasoline?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>There’s a whole raft that are still in existence today and may have actually expanded, but there’s a whole raft of things ranging from vending machines to car washes to haircuts to clothing— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>—to food and so forth. And you go through that list of exemptions and the Governor would say, “Yes, we can cut that. We can eliminate that exemption. Or no, we have to keep that.” It turned out that what looked to be a great gold mine, from his perspective, turned out not to produce a lot of revenue, so then we looked at increasing the rate of the sales tax. In all of this, we were aided by some studies that had been done under my watch on the finance committee, a rep by the name of Miles Rapoport, a very liberal representative from West Hartford, had persuaded the assembly in 1989 to establish a revenue study commission. Miles is now the chair of Demos in New York. Persuaded the legislature to establish a revenue study commission, which was basically the finance committee, but put some money— </p>
          <p>Governor O’Neill let us go ahead and do that, and we hired three national consultants to study the sales tax, the corporate tax, and the income tax and build computer models and do complete analyses of these kinds of things, so we were aided in the analysis of the sales tax by one of these studies that had been produced. The final reports came out in the summer and winter of 1990 during the election campaign and shortly after that, and so we knew how much revenue would be generated by a sales tax increase and so forth, so that remained on the table through probably the third or fourth week of January, something like that, but it turned out that in order to close the gap we’d probably need a sales tax rate of 12 percent.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, that’s—[laughs]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>That was the Governor’s reaction. [laughs] Almost the same facial expression. Chip verified that that number was right. The Governor trusted Chip. He didn’t know yet whether he could trust Cibes or not, but he could certainly trust Chip. So that was a little daunting for the Governor. He said, “Well, now you can look at an income tax to see if there’s some way you can put this together,” and again, aided by the computer models that had already been built. Chip and the revenue section at OPM looked through this and we constructed a budget that would eliminate the selective income tax on interest income and dividends and capital gains, which I think was at 14 percent. It would eliminate that. It would reduce the sales tax and would institute an income tax at, I think, a 6 percent rate, which would close it. </p>
          <p>The Governor was really torn. He didn’t want to do that at all. I don’t know whether he was getting advice from other people. I know he consulted some people down in Greenwich, probably a lot of people from New York City who were active in finances and so forth. I made a pilgrimage down to his Greenwich home to explain what the situation was to some people. I can’t remember now who was there. Of course the Governor was there. I guess it had pretty much been developed, the whole package, but he wanted some economists to look at that, so he called in a panel of economists to ask them generally would it make sense to have an income tax, a personal income tax, or would it make sense to increase the sales tax rate. Well, the economists wimped out, and I’ve since learned this about academics generally. I probably knew it because of my background in academic life, but all these economists—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>There are pros and cons. Is that what—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>No, it was actually even worse than that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It was worse than that? Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>These economists, who in private life in their classrooms would tell you, to a man, to a woman, that Connecticut needed a personal income tax and needed to balance this structure, walked into his office, and I was there, and said we can live with the sales tax increase. Yes. Again, incredulous—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you think they did that because they thought that was what he wanted to hear?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. Absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They were reading their audience.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. [laughs] Yes. They had heard during the campaign, he’d said no income tax, so why should they think things had changed in the last six weeks or two months or something? One of them did not, and I’m trying to remember who it was, but at least had some guts to say it didn’t make sense, and I tried to make the point that there would be a dampening effect on the economy by increasing the sales tax to that level, but the Governor was really torn and remained torn. </p>
          <p>A couple of days later he called me into his office and said, “Bill, I can’t do the income tax. I’m going to do the sales tax,” and I said, “Let me try one more time to persuade you. Let’s marshal all the facts. Let’s have a sit-down. You can look through this,” and he said, “Okay.” A couple of days later we met in the fifth floor conference room of the capitol and we went through it. He said, “Look, I can’t do a 12 percent sales tax.” Chip assured him that it would be that high and he trusted Chip, as I said, and rightfully so. <br>
            So he said, “Okay, we’ll do—” Actually, he asked us to draw up three plans. One was a conventional tax package, one was the income tax package, and one was a plan that was just so abominable that nobody in the world could accept it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So, let me see. They were called aardvark—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>and camel— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The income tax one, and then one in between which was—Oh, I can get—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I can’t remember what “W” was. Camel was for Cibes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh I see. That’s interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Camel was the mascot at Connecticut College. Aardvark was the horrible one. That was cobbled together. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>There was another one, some kind of a beast. I’ve forgot what that one is.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Wildebeest for Weicker. So “W” for Weicker. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. Okay. What was the “A” for? We don’t know. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Just a bad—[laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. Good. [laughs]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It was the worst kind of construction we could think of, so we outlined them all, and he decided eventually to go with the income tax plan, but he didn’t want anybody to know where he was going. He wanted to keep this absolutely secret. He even went to the extent that because the budget has to be printed ahead of time and it’s always printed with absolutely secrecy, it’s printed by an outside contractor. He was so distrustful that this word would leak that he instructed that our OPM staff had to sleep in the office of the printer to make sure that nobody escaped with any copy or any idea of what was going forward. </p>
          <p>So we went through that and our budget chief went over to do that and his trusted aide, and it didn’t leak, but Avice [Meehan] had the idea that maybe a little misdirection would not hurt. She knew that a reporter, whose name I will not mention because he’s still active in Connecticut, regularly went through the garbage cans at the capitol to see what people had thrown out, so she tossed in one of the garbage cans “aardvark” and he picked it up. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>From a garbage—that’s interesting, because in Weicker’s book I think he tells that story and I think he says a copy was left at the top of the stairs or something.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It was in a garbage can. [laughs]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that’s the correction to that. That’s interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>And I guess Avice did it without his knowledge, from what I understand subsequently, but anyway it happened, and the reporter ultimately published it and it looked as if their sales tax was going up, so it was in fact a complete surprise when the Governor stepped up to the podium in the hall of the house and said we’re going with an income tax.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And he describes that in the book as not having been authorized by him, but probably had some salutary impact after all because the notion of a sales tax that would have to be that high had people very nervous and very worried.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you said those six weeks when all that’s going on and the decision is being made as to which direction to go in, obviously given your role, you see that as the most critical time period, and it was in terms of setting a direction.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Right, but obviously going beyond that—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But then it had to get passed.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Then it had to get passed, and I would say that whole period of time, probably longer than six months, from February to the actual passage and through December, when there was an attempt to repeal that—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He gives his first budget message on February 13, 1991. The general assembly passes the budget on August 22, but I know that within that period there were at least three different times that the Governor vetoed— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Right. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003200"></a>0:32:00</p>
          <p class="c-header">Budget passed by Connecticut Legislature</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—the budget that the legislature passed, and there was a partial government shutdown during which time he’s making speeches both to the public and to the Congress, so that must’ve been a very intense time period.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Oh, it was, certainly, for him. I suppose for all of us. Everybody who had some part in it was selling it at the same time as well. Everybody had their own individual responsibilities. I was not to set foot at the capitol, but I was sent out to make some of the speeches. But the critical part of that, and as I said, it did last through December because of the attempt to repeal, was dominated by the Governor’s personality and his courage. </p>
          <p>I often said during that time and subsequently that he’s got a backbone of steel, and that was evident, because once he decided that this was the way he was going, he would not even consider alternatives. It helped that the alternatives were so bad that it was pretty easy to defend, but it’s that kind of courage I think that inspires loyalty of people who work for him. It certainly did in my case, even though I hadn’t worked with him before. He just was completely dedicated and continued to adhere to the decision he’d made. He didn’t waffle around with those things, and it could have been tempting the second or third time with the budget to go in any direction, but he chose not to. One of the things I didn’t see on this gubernatorial timeline was the party on the lawn. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why don’t you tell us about that. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003437"></a>0:34:37</p>
          <p class="c-header">Demonstration and harassment of officials after budget passed</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>After the budget was passed in August, it looked very much as if—people were upset, obviously—but it looked like there might be enough popular uprising to overthrow that, aided and abetted, of course, by a couple Republican conservatives who called for a major demonstration on the lawn of the capitol some Saturday in September I guess it was. Some Governors, I suspect, would have holed up in the capitol or never appeared any place close to Hartford. Not Weicker. Weicker said, “I’m going out there and talking to them.” Fortunately, some cool heads on the part of the state police prevailed and required that he have an escort as he walked among these 40,000 people, and then they hustled him out after things were thrown at him and he was spat upon and so forth, but that was vintage Weicker. </p>
          <p>If I can digress here for a second— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Please. Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>One of the things about the Senator—I’d not paid a lot of attention to his senatorial career. I was focused on Connecticut, but later on in the late 1990s at CSU [Connecticut State University] we had an annual dinner for what we called the Global Majority Retreat for folks who were normally called minorities, but actually around the globe are the majority— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>—and we regularly were able to attract some really fantastic speakers and people who were known in the civil rights community particularly. One of the years we had, I believe the name was Randall Robinson, I’m not sure – </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I know who that is. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>—with an anti-apartheid group in Washington.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. He was the head of some Africa organization.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. You know more details than I can remember at this point, but we were sitting before dinner and he was talking about his knowledge of Weicker. He said at one point they were trying to drum up opposition to apartheid and get the United States government to take a position and he said he got a call out of the blue, “Randall, this is Lowell. I want to get arrested.” [laughter] So they arranged a demonstration and Weicker apparently became the first United States Senator ever arrested.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did he not chain himself to a fence or something like that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Probably. I don’t know the details, but it’s certainly—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Yes. He was the first Senator? Could be.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>That’s what I heard, because the Constitution says during the course of the session the members of the House and Senate can’t be arrested for one thing or another. Well, Weicker was arrested apparently, so to me, that just confirmed what I knew about the Governor as the Governor with an unbending will.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course there was also the Watergate experience— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. That’s very true. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—much earlier on when he was a very junior Senator. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That took an enormous amount of courage.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Absolutely. Just his unbending will, a conviction that once he’s made a decision that he was right and he was going to stick by it. That generates a lot of loyalty.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know about that party on the lawn. It was your euphemism that caught me off guard for a moment. And I also know that there were people who really felt personally vulnerable, in danger in some ways, or that they had suffered various kinds of abuse as a result of supporting the income tax, one of them being [Lawrence J.] Bettencourt, who chose not to run again and felt that his family had been subject to various kinds of abuse, air being let out of tires and threatening phone calls and things like that. Did you ever feel threatened as a result of your role?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>My family was harassed. We’d get calls at two o’clock in the morning from bars where people had ginned themselves up with a few beers to make some calls. My number was in the phone book, so at two o’clock in the morning, when the bar was ready to close, they’d call up and rant for a while, and my wife would get phone calls. I think not as threatened as Larry. Larry was the Senator from my district, but I probably was not harassed as much as Larry was, because Larry was a Republican and had been elected to follow whatever Republicans do. I represented New London, had been outed ten years before as an income tax advocate, and my district had overwhelmingly elected me for five terms. Well, five terms after it became clear I was an income tax advocate, and so by and large I was very supported in my district and in town.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But this is no longer a local issue. This is now a state issue.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I know, yes, but I lived in New London. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>—and that’s where most of the harassment even for Larry came from was his district, not from New London, but from Waterford and the surrounding areas. You know, nobody let the air out of my tires. My family was not threatened physically. As a matter of fact, part of the Governor’s plan on spending reduction also involved some union concessions, and I actually was picketed, my house was picketed several times by the unions because I was too tough on them. [laughs] But it wasn’t, again, a physical threat from that side. I think most of these physical threat kinds of things come from people locally and what their expectations were and people knew where I had stood. I didn’t feel physical threats.</p>
          <p>Oh, I wanted to say something about the party on the lawn if I could. Because of the studies that had been done for the finance committee by the national consultants and some polling that I’d done in the gubernatorial campaign, we knew that the primary opposition to the income tax came from people, from families, earning less than $25,000 a year at that time. Once you got above that level there was 50/50 support, and as you went higher, there was more and more support for an income tax, so we deliberately constructed the income tax so that people who earned less than $25,000 a year would pay nothing. </p>
          <p>That was where there was a lot of opposition, and the Republicans were able to gin up a crowd of people who in the end would not pay any income tax at all, but they didn’t know that. They’d been persuaded that they were going to be really hit by something like this, so the 40,000 who showed up on the lawn of the capitol—I bet 39,500 of them probably would never pay income tax—they found that out when the first withholding period came in October. </p>
          <p>I’m sure that the Republicans strategized to hold the party in September because when the withholding came through and they looked at their paychecks and discovered nothing had been deducted, nothing had been withheld, the opposition pretty much melted away. There was never a big attempt. The repeal effort went forward. That session occurred in November or December, but once people discovered, once the real vitriolic opposition was silenced by learning that they didn’t pay any income tax, that pretty much took the wind out of their sails. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="004347"></a>0:43:47</p>
          <p class="c-header">Initiatives to promote corporations in Connecticut</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know that the Governor also had a strong commitment to improving opportunities for business in Connecticut as part of his goals for the state. How were you involved in those initiatives?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Primarily on the revenue side again. As I mentioned, there’d been these three studies that had been done—sales, corporate and personal income tax. Everybody I think recognized that the corporate tax had been overextended, the corporate income tax. The top rate was 12 percent at the time. There’d been a surcharge of 20 percent on top of that, so it was 14.4 percent. Weicker campaigned on saying we’ve got to reduce the corporate tax, and that was part of the overall package as well. He used the term “no brainer,” but that certainly was a no brainer that you can’t really squeeze blood out of a stone on the corporate side, so that was an essential part, and then the rest of it I think in terms of business support was some deliberate outreach to the corporate community in terms of getting them to recognize that a personal income tax was critical to enabling the corporate tax rate to be reduced. </p>
          <p>I didn’t realize, and this is something you can explore with Tom and others because they were responsible for the political side, corporate side reach, I think, but Weicker had really made some real efforts to reach into at least the corporate community in Hartford to make this pitch. I went to one meeting of, I think, the Hartford Chamber of Commerce, where I fully outlined all of this stuff, but I don’t know that it was critical to their support. They just wanted some reinforcement on that. That was a whole effort that I didn’t know much about, but I obviously responded when I was asked to go make the pitch. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Once this income tax is passed and it’s a fait accompli, do you think it had the impact that the Governor hoped it would have or that you hoped it would have in terms of the economy of Connecticut? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. It’s hard to sort out all the impacts. I’m not an economist. I’m a political scientist. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>But it’s hard to sort out the impacts because in ’88, ’89, ’90 we’d been hit by a triple whammy in the economy of Connecticut—the defense problems— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>—the housing and the banks. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>The housing bubble burst, the banks got into trouble, and the defense contracts diminished as a consequence of the end of the cold war.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>All sounds a little familiar, doesn’t it? [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. And so eventually an economy will work out of that as those things disappear, but déjà vu all over again, I guess. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, it’s remarkable. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>The income tax made it unnecessary to cut aid to cities and towns to any remarkable degree. The income tax enabled the safety net to continue. The original level—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Weren’t there surpluses that began to be realized as a result of these changes? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Pretty quickly, as I gather.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. Unfortunately, not as quick as we all wanted them, so we had to scramble to fill some gaps immediately, and I want to come back to that, but because as the economy improved there was a progressive element to this flat tax. The Governor demanded that it be flat, but because it was progressive up to about $100,000 there was a—I wouldn’t call it exponential, but there was certainly a greater increase as personal income increased than just a regular straight line, so it did generate surpluses. </p>
          <p>One of the problems, of course, was that once surpluses existed, the legislature found ways to give them back, so the rainy day fund was never fully funded. So when a recession occurred again, with a lot of the tax breaks that were given we ran into trouble again in the first decade of this century.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What do you mean when you say “The legislature found ways to give them back”?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>As part of the income tax package, a part I disagreed with, there was a constitutional cap on spending, so it would be difficult for the legislature to give it back in terms of spending more money above and beyond a rational increase, but they gave it back in terms of various what we called “tax expenditures,” increasing the number of exemptions on the sales tax, giving tax credits to corporations— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. I understand.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>—what is called a “property tax credit” on the income tax. Hundreds of millions of dollars have evaporated that way, which caused, in part, the problems in—  well, it’s still with us, in 2011. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Looking ahead to 2012. There was no question in my mind that the machinery of government could continue, re-made but not broken, as somebody said yesterday, “We want to re-make government. We don’t want to break it.” </p>
          <p>You know, it’s a good thing about Governor Malloy. At least he’s got that insight and vision now, but it enabled the machinery of government to continue in ways that were not destructive to the economy, and my recollection is that the income tax would produce about $3 billion a year, something like that initially, but it’s now up to $7 billion and the sales tax was about what we were anticipating, $3.5 billion from the sales tax. It’s now still at $3.5 billion. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>If the income tax had not been in existence, we would have been in deep doo-doo over these last two decades. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure, sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>So it really was an essential part of maintaining the economy, and in the broader sense, I think, of maintaining the services that people have come to expect and the quality of life in the state, and also enabled the property tax, which is still too high, way too high, but at least it hasn’t gone through the roof.</p>

          <p class="c-header">Gambling and gaming and the Connecticut state budget</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I wonder if you were involved in any of the deliberations or discussions about gambling casinos and revenues from gaming. I know the Governor said he was strongly opposed to that, but it happened anyway, and— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>He was, again, a very innovative soul in that. I was not involved in the details of that, but I see from the outside and admire the way he went about that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But would that not have generated substantial revenue as well?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>And it did. It’s now probably up to $300 or $400 million a year, and the Governor, again, it’s like making lemonade out of lemons. Give you a lemon and you’d make lemonade out of it. </p>
          <p>The Governor was opposed to gaming in the state and there were powerful efforts, particularly in the State senate because of friendships that senators had with folks like Steve Wynn and other Las Vegas types to bring commercial gaming into the state. The Governor was adamantly opposed to that, and I’m speaking from outside here because I really wasn’t involved, but the legislature, actually it had a lot to do with the way gaming was defined. The Governor wanted to outlaw all kinds of gaming, and that included bingo. The Governor tried desperately to get this ban on bingo passed, and the Catholic churches shut that down. [laughter]</p>
          <p>Under the Indian laws, as long there were games of chance permitted in the state, then they were entitled to participate as well, to institute that, so Indian casinos were going to be coming down the pike as a consequence of this approval or the failure to reject bingo in the state. I don’t know how he made the contacts. I don’t even want to speculate, but somewhere along the line I’m sure he became acquainted with the tribal chairman of the Mashantucket Pequots and concocted this deal which really did bail out the state budget that year that it was adopted, and so the Pequots were then subsequently able to see the value in permitting the Mohegans to add gaming as well.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Those have become really big, huge businesses for Connecticut, yes?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Right. Unfortunately for the tribes, they have not invested well, and so the Pequots are in danger of bankruptcy. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really? I didn’t know that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>But they can’t go into bankruptcy because nations can’t declare bankruptcy, so yes, they’re really stretched thin.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I thought that was supposed to create a lot of money for them.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It did, and they passed it along to their members. The rumors are every tribal member gets something like $200,000 a year, something like that. And then they made some not so good business decisions in terms of investing in other casinos in other states that didn’t come to fruition. I don’t know all the details of that, but it was, I thought, a genius political move on his part, and I didn’t have a lot to do with it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And the genius political move being—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Being to find a way to extract some money from the tribes. To get the money, first of all, deciding not to fight the casinos, to get a take, this 25 percent of the take from the slot machines, and as a condition, not to permit gaming anywhere else in the state. </p>
          <p>So Weicker got his—there aren’t casinos in Bridgeport and Hartford as a consequence of that, which the Governor won, but also substantial assistance to the state budget. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Long-term health care in Connecticut</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>On another topic with, I think, financial implications—you’ll correct me if I’m wrong on this—I read that Connecticut became the first state to initiate a public/private contract on long-term health insurance, and I know, of course, right now being in the midst of this intense debate about the whole nature of health care in the state, it seems to me with my very limited understanding of financial things that that would have some serious financial implications for the state. I’m wondering if that was one of the policies in some ways that could be enacted because of the availability of a greater revenue stream, or was this just a wash in terms of the economic situation? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It actually has nothing to do with the economy of the state or the budget of the state. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It’s a Partnership for Long-Term Care, I guess is what it’s called.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It doesn’t involve any money passing through, or any financial assistance given.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It passed during Weicker’s time, but it actually had been under development at the Office of Policy and Management for probably a decade before it was passed. The idea was to—well, I guess there is some potential impact on the budget, so I’ll come back a little bit to that—the idea because of the long-term care expenses for Medicaid in the state—we’ve got 20,000 elderly citizens on Medicaid in the state in nursing homes—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Medicaid?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Medicaid. It’s a huge burden on the budget, and lots of people recognized in the early ’80s that there would need to be some effort to have citizens behave responsibly and purchase insurance for long-term care to pay the nursing home bills rather than having them lose their assets as they spent down in order to qualify for Medicaid. That had been in development for quite some time. It was fully developed, I think, in the first or second year of the Weicker administration, and I guess since we knew it was coming we didn’t regard it as a huge thing, but it has served as a model for lots of other states.</p>
          <p>The basic deal is that if a private insurance company agrees to abide by the principles of this long-term care partnership, which basically is that if they do, then the state will step up and say if you get your insurance to pay for $100,000 or $200,000 worth of nursing home bills over a course of however many years you determine, then the state will not require you to spend down to zero of your assets. </p>
          <p>You can preserve, say, the $200,000 you’ve had insured of your assets and go on Medicaid then, the hope being that people would buy this $200,000 of insurance or however much so Medicaid wouldn’t have to pay for that first $200,000. Families could preserve their assets and pass them on to their heirs and Medicaid would be spared some of the expense of caring for families— people who would otherwise go on Medicaid, and the budgetary implication comes about obviously that there are some potential savings to Medicaid, but there’s no subsidy to the insurance companies and no cost to the state other than probably three or four people at OPM who examine these policies and certify that they comply with the rules.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. Back to the broader issue of the work that you were doing throughout the gubernatorial years. You stayed on through the entire administration, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>The chancellorship at CSU became vacant in the spring of 1994 and I applied and got the position, so I left the OPM secretaryship in August of 1994. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it was pretty much the whole term. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It was four or five months before the end of the term.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And obviously, initially with all the issues of passing that first budget and the income tax, you would have had very close and direct and constant interaction with the Governor. Did that continue through the four years?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So how often would you say you and he consulted? Daily?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I didn’t necessarily talk with the Governor every day. I probably talked with him more when Stan Twardy and Tom D’Amore were co-chiefs of staff, and Stan I think when Tom left. I’d talk a lot with Stan, every other day probably or so, but then when Stan left, Tom and Stan had served the Governor well, and this new guy, Searle Field, came in as chief of staff. Searle, too, had been on the Governor’s staff in Washington and I think not knowing Searle at all, very little. </p>
          <p>Searle had been, I think, the deputy commissioner of DECD [Department of Economic and Community Development] for a time before he was appointed chief of staff, so I’d known him a little bit through that position, but not knowing him well I thought it probably behooved me to make sure that we worked together, so I deliberately made an effort to talk to Searle every day. He lived in Mystic. By that time I was living in West Hartford, so as he drove up from Mystic every day, we’d get on the phone about 7:30 in the morning, 7:15 or so, and I’d talk with him for the 45 minutes or so until he showed up at the capitol at 8:00.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s the advantage of cell phones.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>That absolutely was, and even in the last year in late ’93, ’94, I was not only talking with him on the cell phone every day but I’d start off the day in his office at 8:00 and we’d go through things until 9:00 or 9:30. Yes, very close. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you feel you had a very close and detailed contact?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are there issues that you were involved with in those years that you would like to have on the record as important moments in the work that you did? I understand that managing what you did and overseeing it on a regular basis is a major contribution in its own right, but I’m just really asking whether there were critical moments in those four years beyond the passage of the income tax that you think should be noted?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. I guess first of all, I would say that as I mentioned earlier, I was really fortunate to have just a superb staff, deputy secretary, and when she left, her successor.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who was that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Deputy secretary was Lorraine Aronson. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Lori?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. Lorraine.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Lorraine. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>A-R-O-N-S-O-N.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>She’d been at DSS [Department of Social Services] before, and I think the Department of Education as well. She knew everything about state government, and frankly, when the budget involved anything dealing with human services, she did it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It went to her. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I didn’t even touch that, and so she was in close relationship with the Governor, because the Governor, as you know, felt very deeply about human services. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>He probably talked to her a lot more than he did me about the human services side of the budget. After she left, Judy Greiman, who had been counsel at OPM– </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you mind spelling Greiman?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>G-R-E-I-M-A-N.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>—became deputy secretary, and she did a lot more of the policy, and then we had some other folks and I couldn’t name them all, but we had a great staff at OPM. Lori went on to become ultimately the chief financial officer at U-Conn. Just retired. And Judy is now the president of the Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges. A great staff. They really took care of a lot of the management stuff and so I’d get involved in some of the policy things.</p>
          <p>Three things stand out in some ways above and beyond the casino issue, which I think was important. Many of these, because they had fiscal implications, and in fact, in one instance, saved the budget, the first was the decision to move forward with a tax on hospitals. That came about in large part because after we’d run all the numbers on the income tax in ’91 and pretty much were able to guarantee to the Governor that he would never have to ask for a tax increase again because there would be this revenue stream going forward. Well, in the spring of ’92 we discovered the computer model had been wrongly calibrated—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>—and would end up with probably that year, unless we did something, at a hundred million to two hundred million dollar shortfall. In the great scheme of things now, that doesn’t seem to be a lot, but certainly it didn’t bode well for the income tax at the time because we’d said this would cure the ills, and then it wasn’t going to quickly cure the ills. That was the hardest phone call I ever had to make in my life. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The phone call?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>The hardest phone call, when I had to call the Governor and tell him the news that the model had been wrongly calibrated.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I imagine you got a feisty response.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Actually, I thought I would be fired, but he was pretty understanding, because we said we’d try to find ways to fill it. And the way that we did, it was a great idea that came out of one of my staff members in the policy side—Susan Bucknell was married to Don Pogue, who was heavily involved in regulation of hospitals. P-O-G-U-E. He is now chief judge of the United States International Court of Taxes, International Tax Court or something like that, out of New York City and still lives in Connecticut, I think. But Don, being intimately involved with the regulation of hospitals, was aware of a provision in the Medicaid law which basically said if you spend money on Medicaid for hospital reimbursements and you run it through that, then you can claim additional federal dollars. </p>
          <p>Well, we were running the dollars that we paid to the hospitals through this Medicaid process and were getting 50 percent, a reimbursement rate which in Connecticut is very low at 50 percent, getting that money back. Don had the idea that we would tax the hospitals, run that tax through the Medicaid reimbursement system, and then use the money that we got to repay the hospitals. We’d have to vary the distribution formula a little bit, but because of that idea which we were able to grab ahold of and run with, we were able to tax the hospitals about two hundred million dollars and get a hundred million dollars reimbursement. </p>
          <p>The taxed hospitals overall didn’t lose any money. Some individual hospitals did. Some individual hospitals were winners, but overall, get a hundred million dollars in federal revenue max out of that. That closed the budget gap, so that was victory number one. We didn’t have to raise any taxes because we were able to run that through. </p>
          <p>Governor Rowland did away with that. Governor Malloy has recognized the virtue of it and is bringing that back, so that was one thing that I think probably—it occupied the legislature for a time, but probably didn’t get a lot of headlines. But it balanced the budget.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And was there resistance to it?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Not when it was fully explained. We were able to talk with the Republican side, and the Democrats didn’t have any problem, but the Republicans had some issues. We were able to talk through them and make the point that this was a way to get some free money, essentially. So that was one thing.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="011136"></a>1:11:36</p>
          <p class="c-header">Efforts to bring the New England Patriots team to Connecticut</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>A second thing was—and again, not so much budgetary implications, but I spent a lot of time on it—was the effort to get the Patriots to come Connecticut. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>The Governor was hot to do that, and I look back on that, and one of the things that I was amazed about and continue to be amazed about in retrospect is the ability to get government moving when there’s a clear imperative to get it to move. The Governor had this idea. He said we need to develop a credible plan and I think we developed that in something like two weeks. It was incredibly difficult because it had to do with finding a location, determining that it was a reasonable location that could be built on, that there could be the finances available and structured and everybody— </p>
          <p>One of the critical parts, well, two critical parts—the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Transportation, were really critical elements here, and from my working with them, once they were sold on the idea, and the idea, of course, these white males who wanted the New England Patriots in Connecticut, they were all gung ho for that. </p>
          <p>Once they heard about this, they pitched in to an amazing degree, and it’s amazing what people can do when they are fully supportive of something. They didn’t hold back and say, “No, it takes three years to get an environmental permit,” or “No, we would have to build $2 billion worth of bridges and traffic improvements.” They found a way to do that, and so that was a great time when we developed that. The person that we were working with the Governor had known, but we didn’t get the franchise. We had to repeat all of that effort to try to attract another party, which also fell through, but it was a notable effort. </p>
          <p>And then the third thing, and I don’t want to get into a lot of details, but here was a real effort to, again, work together. Pratt &amp; Whitney announced that they were going to essentially leave the state, diminish their workforce, because the taxes were too high. We spent, I don’t know, a month, a month and a half of due diligence trying to find out what the difficulty was and discovered that the real problem was the property taxes in the state that were subject to their property in East Hartford and Middletown and so forth—they were really being highly taxed and they thought probably two hundred million dollars or so was affecting their bottom line. </p>
          <p>We looked at various alternatives and we couldn’t find a way to get two hundred million dollars to Pratt &amp; Whitney. The spending cap precluded an expenditure of that amount. We had to do it through the tax expenditure side and there wasn’t any way to give every manufacturing company in the state a tax break of that magnitude because to give two hundred million to Pratt would probably cost a billion and a half overall.</p>
          <p>Some really innovative people led by Chip I think primarily in my office, who was still there, came up with this idea of developing a research and development tax credit which would pretty much reimburse Pratt for its research and development efforts in the state and would attract higher wage professional engineers back to the state and would pretty much equal the amount of money that they thought was going to be lost. </p>
          <p>We developed the outline. How did we ultimately sell the Governor on this? “Well, let’s get together Saturday. I’m going horseback riding up in Salisbury in the morning and I won’t be able to do anything. I’ll meet you at the boat in Essex in the afternoon.” [laughs] So Searle and I go down to Essex in the early afternoon and Weicker gets on the boat with his family and he pilots the boat around the lower Connecticut River over into Old Lyme where old Searle and I sell him on the idea. By the end of the afternoon, he’s okay. So we go to the legislature and get it done. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s classic.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Classic. Yes. But it kept Pratt &amp; Whitney here. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That was very helpful in terms of these other issues that I wouldn’t have known to focus on and I’m glad we have that as part of the record. Could you remind me of what your own expertise is in political science?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Nothing relevant to what I’ve been doing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It’s judicial politics, constitutional law and judicial behavior, and my dissertation at Princeton was on extrajudicial activities of Supreme Court justices.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you do have an expertise on the Constitution, which I thought was the case.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Which is why I’ve asked, because Governor Weicker, perhaps more in his senatorial role than anything else, likes to say that what motivated virtually everything that he did was a commitment to the Constitution and to issues of constitutionality, and he would say that in terms of in an earlier stage of his life the position he took on prayer in schools and issues about abortion rights and the social contract with a people and things of that sort. So I want to ask you to think about that in terms of the gubernatorial years and whether you would—one could argue that those same overriding principles also affected his years as Governor, or if those were just more practically oriented, pragmatically oriented, toward the needs of the state.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I guess I would say the gubernatorial term was really related more to the needs of the state but informed by a real commitment to, as you say, the principles, the ideals, that he developed based on his reading of the Constitution. We’ve seen a lot of debate over the last 20 years or so about what the Constitution—you know, whether it came from the hands of the framers and has never been changed, and it continues.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Absolutely. I mean, absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>It continues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It can mean so many different things to different people.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>But I think the Governor read the Constitution much as I read the Constitution and found it to be flexibly adaptable to the current needs of the country. You mentioned earlier the Watergate hearings. The understanding that he had of the proper relationship of the executive to the legislative branch was I think a critical element that appealed to a lot of us in Connecticut at the time. </p>
          <p>Clearly, his understanding of the right of privacy as it played out in <span class="court-case">Roe v. Wade</span> and with abortion rights and maybe even—and I probably don’t understand whether Weicker was so completely dedicated to it but, again, the equal rights provision, particularly as it affected those with disabilities under the fourteenth amendment, probably remains a critical part of his beliefs.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And a commitment largely to education and equal education, beyond the disability issue.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes, in that sense— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Beyond the disabilities issue— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Yes. Particularly with respect to, again, equal protection, and related to I guess it was [Milo] <span class="court-case">Sheff v. O’Neill</span> and [Barnaby] <span class="court-case">Horton v.</span> [Thomas] <span class="court-case">Meskill</span>, but making sure that kids in cities are treated fairly. <br>
          </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think it’s both a commitment to the Constitution but also a set of values related to social justice that he would describe as sort of having evolved out of—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>His understanding of the Constitution.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>His understanding of the Constitution, but also his own personal background and how he came to see his responsibilities as actually a person of privilege within the larger society of needing to be aware of those distinctions and trying to create balances and equality as much as possible.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, perhaps two final questions. In his final state of the state message in mentioning what he thought had been accomplished over the four years, he listed the personal income tax, the restructuring and downsizing of the government bureaucracy, encouraging growth of Connecticut business, and increasing funding and resources for children and family services. Would you add anything to that list? Or do you agree that those would be the major accomplishments?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I guess those are pretty much comprehensive. I think I probably would not focus so much on the personal income taxes as getting a rational basis for revenue in the state, but the personal income tax was a critical part of that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It absolutely was.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>And I guess in terms of business, I would say it was an effort to make sure that business was treated fairly and to make sure that they weren’t overtaxed in all this and the Pratt &amp; Whitney R&amp;D [research and development] tax credit deal that—if there was a recognition that there was a benefit to be gained from something like that, to provide that assistance to business. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Obviously those things that he listed would all have been things that you would have been quite involved in.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Well, with the exception of the income tax, where I had to be persuasive [laughs] I guess, those are all things that the Governor was dedicated to, and I took direction and supported where he was going.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Can you tell me as you reflect back what both the highest and lowest moments were for you in those four years?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I think the highest moment was when the Governor decided to move forward with a good rational basis on the revenue structure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>And the lowest moment was as I indicated when I had to make the call to tell him that maybe it wasn’t going to work and that we had to find a substitute, and then the fact that we did made it not the lowest moment I guess. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Maybe another low moment came right before he decided to go with an income tax when he sat me down on the couch in his office and told me that he wasn’t going to support an income tax before he came to the conclusion that he would.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And, finally, I think we’ve already talked about this, but you’ve talked about the Governor as a person of high principles and high commitment that inspired a great a deal of loyalty. I wonder if for the purposes of this project if you are able to make a sort of general statement of what you see as his qualities as a leader other than what you’ve already said, or maybe you’ve already said what you have to say on that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I probably have. I think a vision which admirably supported the best in people, the ideals that didn’t try to beat people when they were down but up to uplift them and the courage to then move forward with that vision, a backbone of steel.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>John Doyle did say yesterday, and I’m sure he’s on record saying it, that he could be very tough to work for as well. Did you feel that way at times?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>I did not. He must’ve been very gentle with me because I certainly felt that I had access to him. I felt that he treated me fairly, more than fairly. I can’t recall any time that he really tore me apart, and I’ve heard that he did tear other people apart. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Indeed. Well, sure, but you had a very special role, I think, in terms of the responsibilities, but everyone did.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>Everybody does. As I reflect back on it I think one of the things that I really consciously made an effort to do was to recognize that I was not elected Governor, and I suspect maybe some people who had run for Governor might think that in a position like I ended up in that I could substitute my judgment for that of the Governor. I really deliberately tried not to do that, to support the Governor, just recognizing that he had been elected. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I understand. This has been very, very informative. I think you so much for being here. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">W. Cibes: </span>You’re quite welcome. I hope it was helpful.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It was extremely helpful and very nice to have this part of his career as part of our record in the project, so thank you. </p>
