          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is Phyllis Leffler. It is April 13, 2010. I’m at 1725 20th Street, Northwest for an interview with Maureen Byrnes on the Lowell Weicker Oral History Project. Thank you for coming today. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>It’s my pleasure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’d like to start by your just telling me your full name and then telling me a little bit about your own background before you joined the staff of Senator Weicker. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000038"></a>0:00:38</p>
          <p class="c-header">Byrnes joins Weicker’s personal staff</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>My name is Maureen Byrnes. I joined Senator Weicker’s personal staff as a temporary loan from the Justice Department in 1983. I came to Washington, D.C., as a presidential management intern in the Justice Department. I had just gotten a master’s in public administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My undergraduate degree is from a place called Le Moyne College, which is a small Jesuit school in Syracuse, New York, where I was an English major and took all sorts of philosophy and history courses—a quintessential liberal arts education. </p>
          <p>After deciding not to go to law school when I graduated from college and taking two years off, I went back and got a master’s because I was interested in the nonprofit sector and public policy. At the very young age of 23 or 24 I was the executive director of a crisis intervention center in Durham, North Carolina, when I was a graduate student. It had the wonderful name “Hassle House,” and it’s relevant and interesting because of how these things come full circle. That was 1982, and President [Ronald] Reagan had essentially just decimated the mental health budget in terms of resources from the federal government. So the local mental health center used to contract out its 24-hour crisis services to this nonprofit, Hassle House. </p>
          <p>Because of the budget cuts, it decided it was going to do its 24-hour service in-house at the local mental health center and would no longer contract out to the nonprofit to provide that part of its services. I had no interest in working in the local mental health center. It wasn’t institutionally even the kind of place of employment that I was interested in working in, and there were some challenges as to whether or not this nonprofit was its primary focus, was going to continue. And as happened a lot of times along the way, Senator Weicker being a big example of this, someone, a faculty member at Carolina said, “Do you know about this presidential management intern program?” Because here it is, the spring of ’82, and I’m thinking, What am I going to do? And no, I didn’t know anything about the presidential management intern program. <br>
            Long story short, I competed for it, I was awarded one, and I left Chapel Hill in the summer of ’82, went to the Justice Department as a presidential management intern, and had a lovely year. It’s a two-year program. I liked the people I worked with a whole lot. They were very good to me. They were very supportive, but I was not very professionally or intellectually challenged by the work that I was assigned there. It was a nice place. The people were really good. </p>
          <p>Someone at the Justice Department said, “You could do a temporary assignment to Capitol Hill. It might be a nice thing for you to get a sense of that.” That person had a connection in Senator Weicker’s office. I remember thinking, <em>Okay, so the Republicans are in control of the Senate</em>. I knew who Lowell Weicker was, in particular because of his leadership around the Watergate hearings, but I wasn’t sure at the time that it made a lot of sense for me to think about many other offices to work on Capitol Hill. But it was interesting to me that Senator Weicker was in the majority and as progressive as he was on social and war powers issues, and those sorts of things. So I do this temporary assignment in September of ’83. I go from the Justice Department. I haven’t left the intern program; I’ve just gone to temporarily work in Senator Weicker’s office to see how the legislative branch interacts with the executive branch. </p>
          <p>And you know, I have to tell you, Phyllis—I’ll try to make some of my answers shorter as we go along. I tell this story a lot, because this is actually how I came to work full-time for Senator Weicker. I go on loan from the Justice Department in September of ’83, and it was in September of ’83 that the Marines were killed in Lebanon. Senator Weicker had been calling for the War Powers Act to be invoked for a long time, so he was a very central figure in the media that weekend. </p>
          <p>It was either a Saturday or Sunday in United States’ time when the news broke. “What do you think, Senator Weicker? You all along said we should be dealing with the act.” I remember thinking he never said, “I told you so,” but he basically said, “This is what I was afraid was going to happen. You either have to fish or cut bait. Either you give them the support that they need to be there or you take them out. You don’t leave them as sitting ducks.” I remember being really impressed with how he handled himself, having been someone who had a very strong position on all that. </p>
          <p>That’s ’83. I think that’s the first year that Senator Weicker then manages, leads, the Labor HHS [Health and Human Services] Appropriations bill. I remember it, and again I’m working on Justice Department things. I can tell you later what I was doing. I wasn’t working on the War Powers act. I wasn’t working on the Labor HHS bill, but I was in the office and I was watching these things. And so I was impressed with how he managed the Labor HHS bill. I would also say that it’s 1983 when the Senate debated the Martin Luther King holiday. I always say that for me, that’s the closest I’ll ever come to watching the Civil Rights bill debated. I was too young at the time when it first happened, but it was essentially what people were arguing back then, and I remember thinking this was a really interesting place to be.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000618"></a>0:06:18</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker criticizes Reagan's foreign policy</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Then finally in November—this was the real tipping point—in November of ’83 we invaded Grenada. And again, not because we’re doing this interview today, I tell this story all the time. The morning after we invaded, Senator Weicker was walking through the floor of the Senate as he and many other Senators will do, to get a feel for what’s the agenda going to be that day. What’s the voting schedule going to be? They sort of get a sense of that. </p>
          <p>Howard Baker from Tennessee was the majority leader at the time, and as Senator Weicker, just as an accident of timing, was walking through the Senate gallery or the floor, Senator Baker, as the majority leader, gets up and propounds a unanimous consent agreement that the Senate commend the Commander and his troops for swift and effective action. The Senate wasn’t televised back then, but we had closed-circuit radio. You could hear the floor on all of our desks in the Senate offices. But what you also always heard before someone started to speak was this funny, creaky noise when a member would pull the microphone to put on the desk or on their person. And it would go “EEERRR,” that kind of thing. </p>
          <p>All of a sudden you hear, “EEERRR.” Senator Weicker says—he’d obviously gone to his desk—“It’s enough that you’ve asked me to turn my back on the fact that we’ve invaded this island. You’ve gone too far. If we’re going to ask the Congress and the Senate to commend the President and his troops—the troops, absolutely.” I can almost do this for you word for word. “When the Commander in Chief says go, you go. Of course we commend the troops. Not the Commander in Chief.” </p>
          <p>He gave the most cogent, beautiful statement about the misguided foreign policy of the Reagan administration without a note, without a staff person. No one knew this was going to happen. It was 10:30 in the morning, whatever time it was, and everybody in the office stopped and listened. It was an incredibly great floor speech, completely extemporaneous. And when it was over—I know you’ve met Kim Elliott, the legislative director at the time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Not yet. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Oh, you haven’t met Kim yet. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>She was the legislative director. I literally walked over to her desk and I said, “If there’s a job opening in this office, I would like to apply for it.” I just thought, This is where I want to be. He is a man of principle, and the staff in the office were so proud. It was that sense of Senator Weicker and his principles, but I also had the sense that that’s why everybody else—well, not everybody—but that’s why most people are drawn to him. So that’s November of ’83. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Now, at this point you are already in his office temporarily? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I’m still on loan, right. Now it’s on tape, which would be great. If the Justice Department ever realized that they were paying my salary while I was aiding and abetting Senator Weicker and all of what he was doing, I dare say William French Smith, the Attorney General, and William Bradford Reynolds, the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, would have been horrified. But it was completely legit, right? You go to a member’s office and you’re on loan from the department. So I’m still on loan. </p>
          <p> What I was assigned to do, which is another one of my favorites, a classic Washington D.C., Capitol Hill story, “Oh, well, this girl is coming from the Justice Department. We know that the Judiciary Committee is going to introduce a bill to revise the comprehensive criminal code significantly, probably in the winter of ’84. We’ll get her to babysit that stuff, monitor what’s happening in the Committee to see what kinds of changes they are going to propose. It will matter a lot to Senator Weicker, but he’s busy in the fall of ’83, so maybe the project this person could do is pay close attention and monitor what it is that the Judiciary Committee is thinking about doing about a comprehensive crime bill.” </p>
          <p>Mind you, I have no law degree. I just had this Presidential internship, but that’s a typical D.C. story. I wasn’t being asked to be a litigator, I was being asked to understand a piece of legislation and think about Senator Weicker’s position, for the people of Connecticut and for himself. You don’t need a law degree to do that. You need certain skills, but—so I was sort of the person monitoring the bill in September through November. Then in December, Senator Weicker had a legislative assistant position open up for transportation issues, and I took it. </p>
          <p>I quit the PMI program. He’d probably kill me for saying this, but part of my story that I tell people too is that I took a cut in pay from the PMI program to work in Senator Weicker’s office as the transportation legislative assistant. So I left the PMI. I always call myself a renegade PMI, because it’s a two-year program and most people go on to stay in high-level positions. It’s intended to encourage young, bright people to stay in the bureaucracy. </p>
          <p>In December of ’83 I went on Senator Weicker’s staff. I officially left the executive branch, no longer was a PMI, and was a legislative assistant in his personal office. As his legislative assistant I was doing a variety of things—I saw you had this in the materials—from ’84 through ’85. At the end of ’85, when there was a position open for the staff director, they call it the clerk, but it’s essentially the staff director of the Labor HHS Education and Appropriations Subcommittee—I was really honored enough to have Senator Weicker ask me if I would serve in that role. So as of January ’86, I was officially a staff member of the Appropriations Committee. Senator Weicker was the chairman of that subcommittee. I was a committee staff person, but handpicked by Senator Weicker and very closely aligned with Senator Weicker, who was strongly supported by Mark Hatfield, the full committee chair. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. And you stayed in Weicker’s office until he left? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I stayed a year, right. Oh yes, right to the very end. I was with him through 1988. I always say that the more conservative Democrat defeated Lowell Weicker in November 1988. And then I stayed on the Appropriations Committee through 1989. Senator Hatfield called me up a day or two after the Connecticut elections and said, “Maureen, I’m devastated about Lowell’s loss, but as far as I’m concerned, whoever gets the Labor HHS bill gets you.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, nice. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>He basically was saying I didn’t have to worry about whether or not I had a job because everyone knew, and I would say with great pride, I was a Weicker person. But Mark Hatfield had a great deal of loyalty to Senator Weicker and to the Committee and said, “These are professional positions. Whoever gets that subcommittee gets you.” Arlen Specter actually wound up being the ranking Republican on the Subcommittee. I did that for another year, but it was that following year that the National Commission on AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] was established. I then was asked to be the executive director, which was how I left Capitol Hill. That was a free-standing, independent commission, and I became the executive director of the commission. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So, in fact then, you just really worked with Senator Weicker for about five years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>’83 through ’89. That’s exactly right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Okay.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Through ’88. I’m sorry. Yes, ’83 through ’88. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>’83 through ’88. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And then you said, I think, a little earlier, and I’d like to go back to this just briefly, that you feel that this experience that you had in his office has then been the foundation for everything else you’ve done since then. Do you think it framed your interests in issues in ways that would not have developed? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Oh, I think in lots of ways, some of which I’m conscious of, and some of which I’m not even aware of. What I know is that he’s the person who gave me so much opportunity. It was great that I became the legislative assistant for transportation, but as a result of the two years when I was on his personal staff I did a variety of things—the transportation issues, which I know you have in the notes. That was also the period of time where we did the investigation of the state mental hospitals and other kinds of things. </p>
          <p>I was lucky enough to be given assignments that had visibility and exposure with Senator Weicker. You can wind up working for a member and the issues are important and they matter to the member, but for a variety of reasons and timing, sometimes that might not really give you an opportunity for that member to see that you can analyze quickly and appropriately and accurately, you can write a draft floor statement, you can negotiate very complicated relationships with people. </p>
          <p>To have opportunity for that, to be seen, both by Kim, the legislative director, but also directly by Senator Weicker, it’s a place where opportunities present themselves. In this case in particular, Senator Weicker was wonderful about asking me to take on some of those responsibilities. I had never investigated state facilities before we did the investigation of the state mental hospitals. You learn a lot doing that. </p>
          <p>You learn a lot on the job and you work with other people and consult with them. There was a lot of politics as well as substance involved in a lot of the things that we did in ’84 and ’85. The Reagan administration, on many social and other issues, was not, in Senator Weicker’s mind, balanced correctly. A lot for defense, cutting social services and health, and so I had the opportunity to watch his way of thinking about focusing on the substance, but using the legislative process and the rules of the Senate to protect some of those issues. </p>
          <p>Being around him, he got to see what I could do, and I learned from him substantively, I think, and politically. And then the fact that he asked me. I had been in that office two years. I came from this PMI program in the Justice Department, and I often say this to people, it’s a great Capitol Hill story. Two years. I worked at Hassle House, right? The director of a crisis intervention service; it’s kind of where my heart is. </p>
          <p>I wind up working in the Justice Department because that was where the openings were in the Reagan administration. They were laying people off in HHS and Education. I wind up in Senator Weicker’s office as the Justice Department person, but then I wind up two years later as the staff director of the subcommittee where all the federal money for mental health services, for disability, for education—I couldn’t have imagined that job. I could have imagined being the Secretary of HHS, I think. But I hadn’t imagined I would have her budget, you know? [laughter] Or Senator Weicker would, and we would work together, so the idea—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, obviously you’d established yourself by that point as a person of real ability, and so Weicker was eager to trust you with this. He knew you well by then. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>It was a real compliment. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It does seem to me from just having gone over as many materials as I have so far, that almost anything he took on became really visible. You said you were lucky to be in a place that had visibility, but it strikes me that his personality and his willingness to be outspoken on issues pretty much put everything he did at center stage. Maybe it started with Watergate, but I also think it was perhaps a function of his personality. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I think that’s a really good point. I think in other offices, you could languish in the corner and someone wouldn’t know about the fact that your bill never saw the light of day, but somehow they needed to be sure they were up on it. But I think that’s a very good point. I think it may well be true for all of us if you asked anybody. They’d feel like they had some visibility and exposure because he didn’t coast on things. He sort of focused on something like a laser. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, it’s on another tape, so I can easily say this. Did you know Bill Strickland? [note: actually it was Bob Wicklund] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I know of him, and I’ve met him, but I know further—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He worked with him on oceans and NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] issues, and Bill Strickland [note: as above, should be Bob Wicklund] tells the story about himself of essentially being someone who never went beyond high school, learned how to dive, Lowell Weicker meets him when he goes down to the hydrolab, a year later invites him onto his staff, and basically made his career. He certainly seems to have the ability to identify talented people who could also work very hard and could be passionate about what they were working on. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I think that’s right. As I said, it was interesting that in that short time that I was there I noticed the other people in the office. It wasn’t just the member. It was like, <em>Oh, look, that’s interesting</em>. People really feel strongly about their issues and about the person representing them. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. And that’s another thing that Bill Strickland [Bob Wicklund] said was one of the things he came to understand about working in Congress, was that so many people were just there for the work, and not the issues. That disappointed him about the Congress as a whole, but it sounds like to me that you’re saying that people who worked in Weicker’s office were able to be really committed to issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes, that was my experience. It’s interesting you should bring that up. I talk about that a lot when it comes to working on HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and AIDS. So that comes pretty quickly as I go on to the Labor HHS Subcommittee, but I’ll tell you in candor, when I first came as the presidential intern, I wasn’t sure at all that this was a town I was going to spend a long time in. </p>
          <p>It was a terrific opportunity. Not everybody gets picked as a PMI, and as I said, it was a wonderful office, but there were some things about it—I’d just come from this crisis center, and here I was thinking about public policy. I wasn’t clear what the alternative was, but I thought, <em>Well, this is okay, but I’m not so sure it’s for me</em>. I’m not that sharp-elbowed, you know, making myself more than am I kind of thing. In Senator Weicker’s office, it felt like home. You know, it felt really good. </p>
          <p>But it was working on HIV and AIDS, it was that moment in time where I thought, <em>This is where I’m going to live</em>. It had everything to do with Senator Weicker, but also the other people I met, because unlike some of the other staff people that I had met that I had worked with on some of the issues earlier than HIV and AIDS, everybody in the early days of working on HIV and AIDS, it was not about their boss. It was not about their own agenda. We were actually trying to figure out how to address the epidemic. And I felt like people’s motivations were different than—you know, this is going to sound so clichéd and trite, but Capitol Hill is filled with people who have big—it’s all about them and power. Working on AIDS was completely different, and it had its own experience. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, so let’s maybe get into some of the very specific issues that you worked on. I do want to talk to you about AIDS. I know before today is over I’m going to want to talk you about legislation in education and disabilities, which I think you were also involved in. And what would you say are the other major issues that were really important to you that you feel you worked on intensively? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Well, I think it’s easiest for me in some ways to do them in—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Chronologically? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Exactly. Okay, the state mental hospitals and the protection and advocacy of the mentally ill is a big one. It wouldn’t have been done without Senator Weicker. He’s responsible for that. In Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, HIV and AIDS of course we’ll talk about today. They are huge. Separate and apart from NIH [National Institutes of Health], although it’s hard to do that—I would say when it came to the National Institutes of Health, Senator Weicker just always fundamentally understood the important government role in supporting basic biomedical research. And there is, I think, a really important piece there. </p>
          <p>Education—although I have to say some of the education major accomplishments, there are some other people who are better suited to talk about this because they had a seat at the table sooner than I did. But some of Senator Weicker’s legacy, and he taught me this, you measure some of your success by making sure they don’t do so much damage, and you measure some of your success by how much you advance the ball on the issues that we care about. And I’d say Senator Weicker, in the field of education, not only in terms of what he did for special education, had a fundamentally terrific understanding of the limited role of the federal government in higher education. </p>
          <p>There’s a program in education—I don’t even know if it still exists—called Chapter One. It provides limited resources from the federal government to some school districts where you’ve got a disproportionately disadvantaged community of children, and it’s a formula program. He always used to say that the money should follow the kids. It’s not take 50 states and how many school districts and divide it up. There were things in education programmatically that I think he, rightfully so, should be well recognized for. </p>
          <p>Ask other people who were literally there, because I think I know this in retrospect, but he would not vote to approve Secretary [William] Bennett until he got an assurance that the Department of Education was not going to be eliminated or dismantled. Now, they kept it, but I’d say they did everything they could to gut the entire department, and it didn’t happen because Senator Weicker was—his being the chair of Labor HHS in that time period is fundamentally important. </p>
          <p>The Reagan administration had a very different agenda about the federal government’s role when it came to education, and health, and labor, I would say. And the fact that Senator Weicker was in that party, which got him the chairmanship of that subcommittee, and yet, so strongly believed in, what I would certainly share, as the role of government in those areas. His legacy in holding back and counteracting Draconian efforts on the part of that administration when it came to all those big agencies, departments, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, you can’t overstate it. It was really phenomenally important that he was in that chair, on that bill, at that time. Education, and special education of course, mental health services as well as HIV and AIDS and public health and research, those are the big ones that I remember well. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Weicker oversees budget requests</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Just for completeness sake, although I didn’t wind up doing a lot of these things afterwards, it turned out that in early ’84, and I’m now the legislative assistant for transportation, there were all sorts of transportation issues that a person from a northeast state cares about when it comes to mass transit and trains and rails and roads. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, that was also an important part of his work. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Oh yes. Absolutely. I don’t know if anyone has told you this story, but it’s one of my favorites. I’m just staffing him on transportation issues, but as the chair on Labor HHS, Senator Weicker often used to ask the heads of agencies like the NIH or the Centers for Disease Control or the Secretary of the Department of Labor, whoever it might be, when they came before the Subcommittee what their budget request was from the Office of Management and Budget. He wanted to know what you thought you needed before it went through the usual—this is how the government works. You can see where the White House agenda and where the agenda of some of the— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>It was our understanding that when you were asked on the record that kind of question, if you framed it a certain way, that person was allowed to answer the question. You know, in other ways, they’ve got to be a good team player, right? They’re there to represent the administration and have the budget be a certain amount. </p>
          <p>Senator Weicker was used to this kind of back and forth with some of the people in these agencies, and I remember early when I started to work for him, Elizabeth Dole was the Secretary of Transportation. I’m pretty sure Senator Weicker—if you ask Senator Weicker, he’ll remember—asked Secretary Dole at the time what her request was, and she wouldn’t answer. He’s not the chair of Transportation, but he was either on that Subcommittee or he was allowed to come in to ask a question because he was a member of the full Committee. “Madam Secretary, what was your request to OMB?” Wouldn’t answer. Wouldn’t answer. Wouldn’t answer. She would say, “I understand you have a budget in front of you,” and this was Senator Weicker, “But can I ask you—” </p>
          <p>Well, anyway, long story short, they go around and round and round, and I’ve never forgotten, Senator Weicker leaned into the microphone and says, “Madam Secretary, are you invoking executive privilege?” [laughter] The whole room, everybody was like that’s really big, about the Amtrak budget, you know. That’s one of the things I remember. I got to do transportation, but I was there the day—I’m pretty sure I remember Senator Weicker asked then Secretary Dole, later Senator Dole, “Madam Secretary, are you invoking executive privilege?” </p>
          <p>Then in the fall of ’84, sure enough, the Judiciary Committee did try to make a lot of changes in the comprehensive criminal code. They knew there were three provisions that were so controversial that if they took them out, they might be able to get the big bill passed, and they would debate the individual bills. I’m not so sure this needs a lengthy place, although there may be people who talk about the Justice stuff that Senator Weicker did. Maybe it would fit in there.    But the Senate debated the death penalty, habeas corpus, which is now huge. </p>
          <p>Many people who follow Guantanamo and other places know what habeas corpus is, meaning does the prisoner have a right to have their case reviewed because, in fact, they may not have been well represented, or there was some violation of their rights. And the exclusionary rule, which is the rule under which Miranda comes up in all these various ways in which you can actually enter into someone’s private home and do a search and seizure. Search and seizure, I think, not Miranda. This shows that I don’t have a law degree. </p>
          <p>But the reason I want to tell you this is that Senator Weicker, again in the face of an administration that was trying to weaken habeas corpus provisions, weaken the exclusionary rule, advance the death penalty, stood up on every single one of those bills and opposed what the majority of his party was trying to do. I had my day in—I wouldn’t say in court, but in Congress, because eventually what I had done for those three months paid off to do that sort of stuff. Those were the issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m glad you talked about these transportation issues, but it seems to me that it’s really the HIV, AIDS, and the education issues that are central to your evolution, your own development, and your passion, because clearly you stayed focused on those for the rest of your career. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What order should we take them in? Should we talk about HIV/AIDS first? Because you said we would do this chronologically. Is that right to talk about that first? I’m trying to remember the trajectory of this. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003156"></a>0:31:56</p>
          <p class="c-header">Protecting the rights of people in state mental hospitals</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Well, we did the state mental hospitals in ’85. I started doing HIV and AIDS in ’86. I don’t know how much you need or want on that. I think this is important. Senator Weicker’s the chair of the Labor HHS subcommittee, and I don’t know if anyone tells you this, but by about 7:00 in the morning Senator Weicker had read all three papers.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, I am really starting these interviews. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>He’s an early riser. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span><span class="work-title">The New York Times</span>, <span class="work-title">Washington Post</span>, <span class="work-title">Wall Street Journal</span>, and I’m guessing the Connecticut papers that he would pay attention to. There was a day he was sitting in his office, and I remember hearing—he might not even remember some of this, but I remember him saying very out loud, “Not on my watch is this going to happen.” </p>
          <p><span class="work-title">The New York Times</span> was reporting a story about a man who had died in a state mental hospital in New York who had been restrained in an overly heated room. He essentially suffocated. And Senator Weicker—in the Labor HHS bill, we appropriated Medicaid dollars, but we don’t have any discretion over them. They are an entitlement program, right? If you’re entitled under the law for Medicaid dollars, you get them. But the mechanism that the federal government uses to provide dollars to the Medicaid program comes through the Labor HHS bill. </p>
          <p>Technically, Senator Weicker’s bill was the bill that funds Medicaid money, and it’s Medicaid that these state mental hospitals get through the patients that they’re taking care of. I always thought it was interesting that again, Senator Weicker. Well, we don’t have any discretion over Medicaid. NIH you can decide ten dollars or six dollars. But Medicaid, if you’re eligible, then you get it. But he knew he had jurisdiction, and he basically said, “I have a bill where money is coming out of the federal government. Not on my watch do you get federal dollars and allow this to happen.” </p>
          <p>I remember him saying, “I want to know what’s going on. Is this just an isolated incident, or how is this going on?” And we had people who could come in and talk with us about that. That’s my recollection of how the investigation got started, and he was always smart about this. I noticed this again in the notes; there’s something called the Constitutional Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. It goes by the acronym CRIPA. And that means if you’re in a prison, if you’re in a state mental hospital, your constitutional rights don’t go away. There are understandings as to how these work in terms of mental hospitals and prisons. Yes, you’re incarcerated. No, you don’t get to go out, but no, the people who work there don’t get to violate your constitutional rights. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>And that’s what we were looking at when we did that study. We didn’t have expertise to say, “Oh, this is the right medicine, or what should that be?” We consulted with experts, but again, Senator Weicker is really clear. People have constitutional rights. And if all this is happening in secrecy, how will we ever know if they’re being violated or if in fact they’re being protected? So the end result of that investigation of the state mental hospitals was Senator Weicker introducing the Protection and Advocacy of the Mentally Ill bill. And what it called for was for certain people to be able to just appear at these institutions without notice and come in and assess the conditions within that institution to determine whether or not in fact people’s constitutional rights were still being respected. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you did your own trip, right? I mean you went around to various— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Oh yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>About 30 different mental health facilities. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Thirty sounds high. But we did go to a lot of them, all around the country. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Was there a team of people who did this? How did that work? Let’s talk about that for a moment. Did you choose individual places to go, or did you go as a group? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Ah, okay. Yes, it was a team and I thought the list looked right to me that was in here, in terms of who the people were. This is how you always do your work as a congressional staff person, maybe in life anywhere, and in different kinds of careers, I guess. You have to go find the experts and you consult with them. </p>
          <p>We were not experts on institutionalized care, some more so than others. There were a couple of people in the office who knew the field. But we identified the people in New York who were the advocates who were very upset about what happened to that man in that hospital. <br>
            There were advocates who were engaging with Senator Weicker and his staff around the rights of people with disabilities of all kinds. You begin to identify experts outside your own little circle who know a lot about institutions, who know how they’re run, who know who the advocates are who are fighting with the administration of their various facilities. </p>
          <p>Journalists sometimes are a very good source. They’ve been monitoring things in a particular state and they can tell you who to talk to and where to go. So we consulted with variety of people and identified a variety of institutions to visit. And rarely is this a pure science. You go where you’ve got good contacts because you’ll get access in a way that you might not get if you were trying to do this cold. You pay attention to geography. You don't want people to think, “Oh, this is a problem with just the northeast and the southeast.” </p>
          <p>You want to make sure you went to a variety of other places, and we did divide up. We went in teams of two, as I mostly remember. I don't remember how it is that we decided who was going to go where, but usually it was two of us. And then it’s again, very typical I think, of how these things work. The group of us came back together and just thought a lot about how to put a report together that would now tell the story of these people and what role the government could play in addressing what was happening to them. I have to say it is the precursor for me—I’ve often said this—to HIV and AIDS, where I remember feeling a real burden of responsibility. We were going to be the voice for these people. They’re locked in an institution. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>There’s not a lot of opportunity for them to have anything to say. But they did. Senator Weicker gave them a hearing. And in that respect, for me that was a major professional development in terms of putting the report together. I think it’s fair to say that they were three of us who really put the report together. Everybody on that team did a lot of work out of town, late at night, traveling. It was a fairly significant endeavor, and everybody contributed to the report. One of the reasons I remember this is—again, I guess I don’t know how I got this experience or skill, but the report was lengthy. We had multiple outlines. You know, what do you start with, what’s the middle, what’s the end? Sometimes it’s hard to know that, even if you’re trying to put an outline together.</p>
          <p>But anyway, I remember one day, I kept saying, “No, it’s not there yet, it’s not there yet. It’s just data. It’s just a lot of stuff. I don’t know what story it tells. I don’t know the story it tells.” And one day finally I said, “Okay, I think we’re there. I think we’re cooking.” He might not remember this, but I remember one colleague saying, “Oh this is great. Okay, finally, Maureen thinks we’ve got it right.” And I said, “Oh no, no, no, no. Chapter three needs to be chapter seven and chapter eight needs to be chapter two. But at least the raw material is all there.” [laughs] I remember the three of us spending a lot of time putting it together. </p>
          <p>When we released the report, it opened up the opportunity to have a series of hearings where people came and testified before Senator Weicker and the Committee. And out of the report and out of those hearings we then had the documentation. You don’t just willy-nilly, although some people do, stand up and introduce a bill. It’s based on findings, a problem, and a solution that you think the federal government has a role in playing. That’s how that got framed as the—we said okay, we think one opportunity—there are other things in the bill, but these unannounced visits on the part of people who can come in and see whether or not in fact certain things are being taken care of—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And does this end up being then the Senate bill 974, which is called the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Persons Act? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes. It became the law. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Have you followed that since then? You don’t know whether it’s being gutted or still really— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>No, I don’t know. As you interview ask others, because they may have followed it more closely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I will. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="004138"></a>0:41:38</p>
          <p class="c-header">Seeking funds for mental health research</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>There’s one last story that’s related to mental health issues, just to put them in the same basket, but I’m going to give you a different venue. The investigations happened in 1985. I became the staff director of the Labor HHS Subcommittee, and I saw that you had some of this stuff in the materials in ’86. I think it was ’86, but it could’ve been ’87. But the story’s worth telling, and you could figure out which year it is. </p>
          <p>In one of those years, Senator Weicker was advocating the importance of—I saw this in your notes—making sure that we invested in schizophrenia research. He was advocating that we adequately provide federal support for mental health research, and there were a lot of controversies in mental health throughout the Reagan administration. It really was an area that they were particularly hostile towards in terms of investing in these. Sometimes you could get them to do the research, but services—it was just terrible. </p>
          <p>Senator Weicker saw that and recognized it. He spoke pretty forcefully about the importance of the federal government continuing support because it was so promising. One of those decades was the decade of the brain. People saw that this was an area not only where there was need, but if you put the money in the science, scientists were saying they thought they could actually make significant advances when it came to drug therapies in particular, and that would change a lot of people’s lives. </p>
          <p>So Senator Weicker had gotten known—two things about these hearings—within the Department of Health and Human Services. “Wow, the chairman really cares about making sure we invest in schizophrenia research.” The administration proposal that year essentially took the money out of research for manic depression and put it in schizophrenia. I remember Senator Weicker saying at one of these hearings, “Do I look stupid? Who would ever think it was a good idea to take money from this community to fund the—” so he fixed that. He’s like, “No, we’re not robbing Peter to pay Paul. We’re going to do this.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Then the Labor HHS Subcommittee hears from all of the government officials about what money they’re requesting for government programs in the coming year. At the end of these hearings there’s always something that we call public witness testimony. That’s where average people, citizens, can come and petition their government. It’s a challenging one for Labor HHS because it is every rare disorder and it’s painful. But it’s a beautiful thing to come and talk to your government and request funding for X, Y, Z. </p>
          <p>There was a time that a gentleman came to testify about the need for money to go into mental health services and research. Senator Weicker might remember who he was; I don’t remember who he was. I tell this story about Senator Weicker a lot because I think it really tells you a lot about who he is. </p>
          <p>This man knew he was being clever, but at the end of his testimony he said, “Mr. Chairman, all I can tell you is, if the day ever comes that you run for President, you have the vote of the mentally ill.” I don’t think he said “crazy people,” but he said, “You have the vote of the mentally ill.” Everyone in the hearing room laughed. I bet I giggled. It was funny the way he said it. He knew what he was doing. Senator Weicker never cracked a smile, sat perfectly still. I’m right next to him; he’s in the chairman’s seat. He sat perfectly still, but I noticed this. Oh. This is how he also taught me: He sat perfectly still, waited for the room to quiet down, and then he leaned forward and says, “It would be an honor, sir.” And it just was— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Beautiful. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Beautiful. Really, really beautiful. He wasn’t going to make a joke out of it and then he knew how to stay back— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Even as he knew that people might use that comment against him politically. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>“It would be an honor, sir.” I’ve never forgotten. It was really a beautiful thing. So those are the things I mostly remember in terms of my direct connection to the mental health issues. The investigation of the hospitals and trying to not allow the Reagan administration proposals to do what they were doing to— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Now, who are the people, if you can remember, who were the greatest thorns in your side in terms of that legislation? Were there specific members of Congress that you had to convince or battle? Aside from just the Reagan cuts for social programs, were there specific individuals that you needed to develop strategies to manage? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>You know, on mental health issues I remember it being more the problem with the administration. Somehow that wasn’t where federal resources were to be spent. On the Committee, I don’t remember people being specifically hostile towards Senator Weicker’s desire to restore the money. In fact, I’d have to point out that Pete Domenici was a member of the Subcommittee at the time and a strong advocate because of family connections to mental health services. It was less about people being hostile towards Senator Weicker’s desire to restore mental health money than it was at the end of the day, did the money that Lowell wanted to spend there limit how much money they could spend on whatever other project they— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. So it was choices of— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>It was more about resources, I think, in mental health. AIDS, a little bit different. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>But on mental health—other people may remember bigger enemies in the legislative branch or on the Committee. My memory is that the administration was so bad about going so deep. Cutting it so dramatically that it took a lot more money out of the bill to get it back to even what it was the year before, and the debate with the Committee members was more about balance and resources for other programs, less about whether they had a particular pet peeve or something stronger about mental health. I don’t have a strong recollection of it being a big— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know this has been in the literature a fair amount. To what degree do you think that Lowell Weicker’s interest in this was related to his own experience with his son, Sonny [Weicker]? He does talk about that a little bit in his book, Maverick, but others then say his interest in this really preceded all of that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Right. I never knew him without Sonny. So it’s hard to know, right, what may or may not have been the case. But I would say that I think there is a very, very, very strong chance that Senator Weicker would have been the exact same champion for these kinds of programs, for this role of government, had he not had a personal experience with it, because I used to say this to the folks that I worked closely around HIV and AIDS, Senator Weicker just has a fundamentally strong feeling about the government's responsibility to protect the most vulnerable. It goes back to this Constitutional Right of Institutionalized Persons Act. </p>
          <p>He’s not a psychiatrist, he doesn’t know that, but he knows what people’s rights are. I think he has a sense about unfairness. He sees it, he recognizes it, so that if a class of people are being treated unfairly, I think he just has a natural connection, sees it, and then as a government official, an elected official, and maybe it would’ve been the case too in another walk of life, but he then says, “Wait a second. My business is to know about the role of government.”</p>
          <p>Now people debate that, right? That’s an interesting question, too, about—he’s a Republican, and Republican and Democratic parties have different interpretations of the role of government, but he fundamentally believes in the government, which is why I have such a strong connection to him. I don’t know where mine comes from, but churches can reject people, jobs. Although you can’t really do that legally, families can reject people. Not the government. The government has a fundamental responsibility in certain areas to protect people’s rights, to protect the public’s health, and to advance us as a society. And he always understood that. </p>
          <p>So when it came to a disproportionately high number of people with HIV being gay, Weicker becomes somebody who fundamentally understands gay rights, but he comes into it like, <em>Wait, this doesn’t seem fair</em>. And you look at kids with disabilities, “What do you mean they can’t go to school? That doesn't seem fair. What do you mean people of color? That doesn’t seem fair.” And so he sees unfairness and then he says, “The government has a role and I’m a government official with power. I’m going to think strategically about how to hold the government—not to impose my impressions and opinions on people—I’m going to hold the government accountable for its role.” </p>
          <p>I think it’s very reasonable to believe that he would have been as outspoken and influential on some of these issues without the personal experience, but it’s very hard to ever know that, and in some ways it’s a wonderful thing, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Because all of that intellectual and political is only reinforced by a wonderfully emotional sense of someone who is so important in his life. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, also the legislation to streamline children in educational programs. I mean there’s the issue that we’ve just been talking about, about mental health institutions and making sure that they’re not abusing people and that they’re properly run. But there’s also the issue about allowing people with disabilities to fully access the educational system, and that comes much earlier in the process, doesn’t it? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes, that’s before my time.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it’s really early ’73 and ’75, also a time when he’s in the Senate and a very young Senator, and strongly committed to that. So in some ways it’s all a piece of that same puzzle, right? That same process of giving people as many rights as you can to allow them to be fully a part of the American establishment, whatever it is, whether it’s education or the services that are provided them. So they’re different issues, but somehow the thinking, I think, must be consistent. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Oh, yes. I think he came to elected office with it. Like all of us, it gets shaped and formed by experiences, but there was something about Senator Weicker early on in the Watergate hearings. You see it early on, where he has that clear belief about the role of government. And then it depends on what you’re trying to get done. To your point, how do these come up? Is it personal, or other things? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m just looking right here in my notes. In ’73 Weicker votes to override [Richard] Nixon’s veto of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act, giving $2.6 billion for rehabilitation services and expansion of assistance to the handicapped. And in ’75 Weicker votes for the Education for Handicapped Children Act, which ensures the right to education for all handicapped children and provisions. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes, well, you’ve got to believe that his experience with Sonny has just got to—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So there it is. Well, and as you say, that’s fine. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>That’s wonderful, actually. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Because he understands it in a deeply personal way. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Right. I think it’s a plus. Yes, I agree. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Would you like to take a break for a moment before we go on for AIDS, or are you okay? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I’m okay. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="005458"></a>0:54:58</p>
          <p class="c-header">Advocating for people with AIDS</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Great. Let’s go on to AIDS because this is absolutely fundamental for you and your career and such important work was done. You’ve already talked about the fairness issue. Would you argue that AIDS became such a priority for the Senator because of this fairness issue, or do you think there were other things that were driving it? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I would say it’s one of a couple. I think the fact that there was a public health epidemic while Senator Weicker was the chair—it’s a little bit like I’m the chair of that subcommittee, and people are dying in mental hospitals. I’m the chair of this subcommittee, we need to do something about the epidemic. I think he had a responsible role in the legislative branch that’s related to a national-international challenge around HIV. Part of it I think is, as you know, Senator Weicker felt so strongly about the role that the NIH plays in this country, and about the scientific independence that the institute directors and the scientists who are funded through the NIH should have. He was always, always highly protective and very concerned about anybody trying to politicize the scientific research. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, it’s in a lot of the documents, actually. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Very, very clear about this. Again, the role of the government is to fund research, but the job of the scientist is to investigate or initiate it for the overwhelming majority of the effort. In some cases it’s a little bit different. So here is this person who is who he is, who also now is the chairperson of that subcommittee that recommends the funding for, well actually is the one who sort of pushes a bill through to fund the NIH, to fund the Center for Disease Control, all those public health agencies. But the NIH is important. </p>
          <p>Senator Weicker always had this very strong feeling about the role of government in basic research, cared a lot about the National Institutes of Health, kept battling the Reagan administration every year, that kept trying to zero out the money. No, that’s not fair. Not zero it out, but dramatically reduce it so that it wasn’t getting what Senator Weicker thought it needed to be able to move forward, to find new cures, develop new therapies, etc. And he really felt strongly about those institutes not having a lot of politics imposed on them. </p>
          <p>So when those institute directors are saying, “Oh my goodness, we have a public health epidemic on our hands. We don’t know how the virus works. We’re still trying to figure out how it’s transmitted. We sure don’t have a magic bullet,” he heard the scientists clearly saying, “We have a problem that we need to deal with,” and he said to himself, however he does this, “Okay, I’m the person in charge.” </p>
          <p>Then it turns out that problem is a national problem, an international problem, but the personal experience of the epidemic is disproportionately being experienced by gay men. And he can’t help—I would say there’s the fairness thing, where Weicker all of a sudden sees Jesse Helms and the Reagan administration and all sorts of other people saying, “We’re not going to do anything.” I’m paraphrasing, so I should be really careful, but basically saying, “We don’t want to put money into this. We know who the constituency is.” Senator Weicker must have said five thousand times when I was working with him, “When in this country did we ask you how you got sick? Unless, of course, there’s a whole class of people that you would like to discriminate against, and apparently that seems to be what’s going on here.” </p>
          <p>There was an unfairness piece—mild words to describe what was happening. There was blatant discrimination, hatred, ugliness, meanness, awfulness, an unfairness thing happening, a very dangerous public health epidemic that we don’t really quite have our hands around yet. When you think about the early to mid-’80s, and here he is literally in the seat of responsibility and basically saying the scientists are telling me we really need to start funding research in this area. And more and more I’m hearing from people who are saying, “Oh my God, look what it’s doing to an entire community of people.” So those things all came to be in a place where Senator Weicker recognizes a serious problem and uses his position. He would argue quite appropriately that that was his job, Lord knows I couldn’t agree more, to say first of all, the federal government needs research dollars. </p>
          <p>There was a real progression with this—you give the NIH money. For goodness sakes, figure out what this thing is. What’s the virus? How is it transmitted? Understand the virus. Then when the scientists are basically saying to Senator Weicker, “We’re understanding this virus, and there is not going to be a quick fix to this, viruses are complicated things,” he then realizes it, and again people are now coming to us and giving us information about this, we had to think about how you talk about education and prevention. If you don’t have a cure, then you want to keep researching whether or not there is a cure. But the federal government, because of the role that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plays, has a role in educating and preventing. Preventing the transmission of diseases for the good of the public health, as well as for the individual. </p>
          <p>All of a sudden now you need to be funding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And I just would flag for you, Phyllis, that’s where it really starts to get—there,  some of the others, the bath houses get controversial—but whenever you are going to be talking to the community, however you might define the high-risk community, not the public at large, we’re now going to use federal dollars to talk about how the virus is transmitted at that point. We’re beginning to learn that it’s transmitted sexually. What are the various strategies one might engage in to prevent transmission of this virus? All of sudden the word “condom” is coming up, and all sorts of other things. </p>
          <p>So research the virus, no quick cure, and money for prevention and education, because that may be the only thing we can do right now to try to reduce the huge numbers that most of the public health people were telling us were going to happen. And then eventually you look at the role that the federal government plays in paying for health care services. Gay men typically were not eligible for Medicaid dollars, and many of them were working and then lost their jobs and lost their insurance, so there was this whole progression of things where in fact, what were going to be the appropriate support services, if people live that long, to provide health care services, and what were the complications and about engaging with the health care delivery system. But I would say the NIH and the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and Senator Weicker’s fundamental belief that there’s a government role in funding research, and also thinking appropriately not only for the community at large, but for people at risk, issues around education and prevention. Those are where—and access. </p>
          <p>You have this right about access to the experimental drugs. He did a great thing, and we should at some point pause and just I’ll walk you through that, because it’s a great example of how things can happen. But a lot of the controversy is about how much to spend on it, so Senator Helms—and I would single him out, although there were others—often would talk about not wanting to spend any money at all. But when you got to talking about how the virus is transmitted and what you might need to do to prevent it, we were off to the races. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s when it got really nasty, huh? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes. Really bad. Ugly. Mean. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So clearly you’re saying that his role as chairman of this major committee was what really enabled all this work to get started at all. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Huge. You make this point in the notes I read before I came. Henry Waxman and Ted Weiss, isn’t it interesting that all their names start with a W? Waxman, Weicker, Weiss. Ted Weiss and Henry Waxman on the House side were really trying very hard to get the government to confront what was happening, right? Again, Ted Weiss, New York City, Henry Waxman, LA in California. The numbers are becoming frighteningly larger, and larger, and larger. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They had become a constituency too. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>And a bigger constituency too. They were both people who paid a lot of attention to health as government officials, but they also had it literally in their own back yard and could see what was happening, and in their own right would say, “What’s the role of the government?”  But remember this. The Democrats were in the majority in the House. They’re fighting a Reagan Republican White House. It was very hard to get legislation through the Congress in those years because you have to get the President to sign the law. So unless— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Or override his veto. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Or override his veto, which was actually pretty hard back then. So the Democrats on the House side, well intended though they were, and they were great—Ted Weiss and Henry Waxman were terrific on this, and early terrific—but they couldn’t get a law passed, right? Because it’s going to be hard to get it through the Senate. You’ve got a Republican-controlled Senate and you have to have both chambers to support this, and then you’ve got to get the Republican President, who hasn’t said a word about HIV and AIDS for such a long time, to sign the bill. That’s going nowhere. That’s just not going to happen, and it’s certainly not going to happen quickly while this epidemic is happening. </p>
          <p>What do you have? You have Lowell Weicker, a Republican, the chair of the money committee for all of these health agencies, and the Reagan administration needs to have that bill signed by the end of the year. Appropriations bills get signed every year, hopefully. I mean, that’s when the government gets shut down and we get a little sidetracked sometimes. But these are must-pass bills, so you’re going to negotiate the daylights out of them, right? In order to get the administration to sign them. But you put some things in there that the administration wants and you get the Senate to pass this bill, and you get the House to pass the bill, and you have the capacity to get the government to do something because—I would say this carefully because there’s a House and there’s—you have a checkbook. </p>
          <p>We are the money committee, and it’s the money committee that has to have a bill signed by the end of the year or the government shuts down, right? Departments don’t work. Senator Weicker being in that position, supported by Mark Hatfield as the chairman of the full Committee, and being the person that he is, who cared about science, cared about public health, and knew all along, as it was unfolding, there was also a piece of discrimination going on here about who this virus was particularly affecting. </p>
          <p>I just don’t think you can overstate how fundamentally key Senator Weicker’s role is in the federal government, finally, later rather than sooner, no fault of his, in responding to the HIV epidemic. He’s the man when it comes to—Henry Waxman will tell you that. If Ted Weiss were still alive he would tell you that. Most people in the community who were paying attention to it, and sadly many of those people have died, would tell you that. Senator Weicker is how the federal government finally started responding to the HIV epidemic. But by then it’s ’85, ’86, ’87. It’s pretty late. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And why do you think the debate on the floor was as heated as it was? Do you lay that at the feet of particular individuals? Or do you think there were just larger fear-based issues within the society?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Well, Senator Helms was a gay basher. If you read what he said on the floor of the United States Senate, I don’t think you can describe that any other way than gay bashing. Homophobic is too mild. He had a particular problem with—as he would say—homosexuals, so I would single him out. That was an issue for him, and he certainly did not want the federal government doing anything that looked like they were getting special treatment, much less whatever. So he’s a problem, and we can talk about two examples, I think, about that. Well, no. I’m going to tell you this example because then it goes to the question of constituency and the public and how did that fit into the other elected officials. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="010808"></a>1:08:08</p>
          <p class="c-header">Funding AIDS prevention and education</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>As part of the Labor, HHS bill, we were trying to fund some prevention and education programs at the Centers for Disease Control. There were all sorts of structures around these dollars where you would get a community committee together and the CDC was going to implement it in all sorts of ways that would be community relevant and all sorts of stuff. I say that because at the time that bill was going through and the money for the CDC for prevention and education was going through, at one point there had been a comic book produced by the Gay Men’s Health Crisis. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Not a penny, not a penny—let me underscore—not a penny of federal money went into that comic book. It was graphic and it was very, very specifically targeted to a community of gay men who were engaging in behaviors that we now knew put you at a very high risk of transmitting HIV. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it was really targeted to teach people about prevention.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Right. It was not a comic book for entertainment purposes. It was for prevention,  but it was done in a way that they thought would actually attract the attention of people who otherwise might not read a health department pamphlet or something like that. So Gay Men’s Health Crisis produces the comic book, and we’re now talking about giving the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention money—by the way, an agency that would vet how it would use the money—for prevention and education. Jesse Helms uses the Gay Men’s Health Crisis comic book as the sort of centerpiece of why it is that the federal government should not be funding education and prevention efforts around the transmission of HIV. I believe he may have even had a copy of it, waiving it around, but the comic book, the comic book, the comic book. </p>
          <p>I remember this so clearly because at one point I said to Senator Weicker, “I checked with the CDC, I’ve checked with the Gay Men’s Health Crisis. This is a straw—we don’t even fund this kind of thing. This is not how these dollars are going to be spent.” We wouldn’t actually talk about using federal dollars. So Senator Weicker says to me, “Are you sure? Are you sure?” “Yes, Senator, I’m sure.” He only did this once I think in my entire career. He said to me, “Are you absolutely sure? I’m about to stand up on the floor of the United States Senate and declare that not a—” So I literally went back and called them and said, “We’re about to do this. Are you absolutely sure?” I come back and say, “No, there’s no money.” </p>
          <p>Jesse Helms comes up with an amendment, which is how he’s using the comic book. He uses it to argue. He wants to put language in this appropriations bill. Let’s say we’re giving a hundred dollars for the Centers for Disease Control. He wants to have what we call a rider put on the bill that says—I can’t recall the exact original language, but in the end, Phyllis, none of the funds in this bill can be used to promote and encourage homosexual sexual activity. That is the watered-down version that eventually got voted on. </p>
          <p>In Senator Helms’ mind, education and promotion were the same thing. So if you were telling someone about how virus is transmitted, you’re promoting the behavior that you’re describing, and he wanted that clearly said. So he has an amendment that was horrible, ugly, awful, terrible. I can’t remember, I probably blocked from my memory what it said. </p>
          <p>Senator Weicker winds up working with Senator Helms to negotiate that language. He’s not going to go away. The amendment was going to get offered, so it wasn’t uncommon at all to try to get the language to a place where in some cases in legislative process it’s acceptable. In other cases, you at least know you’ve taken out the most horrific thing, but it is still unacceptable. That went on for quite a while. We negotiated the original language, all sorts of stuff. Eventually what winds up in the amendment is, “None of the funds in this act can be used to promote or encourage homosexual sexual activity.” </p>
          <p>Everybody in the chamber, the Democrats, I want you to keep this in mind, as well as Republicans, knew that this—nobody is coming near the Senate floor. This is ’87 or ’86. I think ’86. Nobody wants to be around this. You know, they’re talking about sex, talking about gay people, money, but it’s ’86. It’s an election year. There was nobody, nobody. I used to say that to Senator Weicker, even on the other side of the aisle, “Where was everybody?” </p>
          <p>Everybody knows this thing is getting negotiated and everybody’s hoping that this language is going to get to a place where it’s going to be okay. We’re all going to say, “Okay, it’s—” In the end, that’s the language. Senator Weicker comes out before they call the vote for the amendment. As the manager of the bill who had been negotiating all of this, he clearly declares, “I’m voting no on this. It’s not as horrific as when we started, but it’s still bad, and I’m voting no.” </p>
          <p>That amendment passed, 94 to 2. Only Lowell Weicker and Pat Moynihan opposed that amendment. I will never forget it. I have friends who at dinner parties will say, “Tell us that story!” Ninety-four to two, because I remember saying to Senator Weicker, “I guess I understand the Helmses of the world. It’s the other 93 I don’t get. How did that happen?” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So what do you think? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>To be fair, I think it’s possible that some people really weren’t paying close enough attention and knew that Senator Weicker had at least negotiated the language so that it was better than it was. So to be fair, you could be thinking, Oh, okay. Something’s come out of that, and I can now— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s the best we can get. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>The best we can get. It was an election year, and I do think people were very worried about being characterized as soft on the gays or pro-gay. Somehow if you did the education of this thing, it will just also allow this. People were beginning to read about HIV and AIDS, so it’s as much about being gay and it’s also about infected gay people and were you protecting in some fashion. Not that they think other heterosexual people are at risk at that time, but somehow you were doing something for a community of people that was doing all sorts of stuff that everybody was uncomfortable with. </p>
          <p>I can’t really ever explain it for you. Senator Weicker might be much more kind and generous about this if you ask him someday. I can’t. I can’t explain to you why. I know the times were hard and I know that there was constituency politics. I know that as I said, some people were up for election, and if you track that I think it would explain some people’s votes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, we have moved a lot, I think, as a country. You might not share this view given the work you do, but I feel that we’ve moved quite a distance as a country in terms of acceptance of gays generally. I don’t think there could be the same kind of reaction as there was in ’86.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Right. We just won’t let them get married. [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, we do in some states. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>We just won’t let them openly serve in the military. I would agree with you, of course it’s a lot— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think the fear is very different. I think there was really enormous fear of transmission of the disease and also the sense—I mean this is really not about what I think. But – </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Right. No, that’s okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I’m wondering to what degree those—clearly the anxiety in the times, and the fear, and in some cases the abhorrence factor might as a combination explain those votes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I think that’s right. I think that’s disgraceful. This is 1986, you know. This is not 19 whatever. Senator Weicker understood this. Pat Moynihan understood this. As I said, there are some reasons why if you go back and look at why some of our closest friends—why was that happening? And I would tell you, Phyllis, that within the next year or two it began to change quickly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Well, the epidemic was getting so big. People were better understanding frankly, that to be honest with you, it was not just gay men who were affected by the virus. We now understood there was a very high population of intravenous drug users who were again now needing services, needing to be recognized. The numbers were getting so big and populations were beginning to diversify. Now, I want to quickly say, sadly enough, once again into incredibly vulnerable communities, right?  I mean, not a lot of people standing up on the floor and defending the rights of the drug users.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Intravenous drug users, especially during the Reagan administration. [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes, right. But I think the numbers—yes, people got educated by their own communities. There were stronger advocacy groups that were going to see their members that were helping them understand the magnitude of the problem, the fact that something could be done around prevention and education, that it was beginning to diversify into other constituencies. You have members who cared a lot about what was happening with the drug crisis, and now we have another thing on top of that. </p>
          <p>So it did begin to—members moved into the voting with Senator Weicker category quite quickly over the next couple of years. We lost a lot of amendments over the next couple of years, so it wasn’t a majority early on. But you’d see 30, you’d see 35, you’d see 39, it wasn’t 2.  Within a year you had many more people. </p>
          <p>The Democrats took over control of the Senate in the fall of ’86. So now you have Senator [Edward M.] Kennedy who’s chairing the Authorizing Committee, you have Senator [Alan] Cranston from California who’s chairing the VA [Veterans Administration] Committee. There’s a lot of drug use in the VA community. There’s all sorts of reasons why this was a particular concern around the VA community. All of a sudden you see so many other leaders who are now also in positions of power. Senator Weicker now is in the minority, but he had a long history, obviously, of being very good on these things. </p>
          <p>So it begins to turn pretty quickly, and I think you’re exactly right about how you would describe it. But I still have a very strong, sad feeling about that day, that only two people stood up that day. But others came along very quickly as leaders. Senator Kennedy was a leader.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it’s actually 1987 when Reagan establishes the Presidential Commission on HIV, which I guess is called The [James D.] Watkins Commission, is that right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes. So a little quick thing on that? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. How did that play into this? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Well, this is a good story. I haven’t thought about these for a long time. Absolutely, positively President Reagan created that commission to side-rail, is that the right term? To sidetrack. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sidetrack.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>To sidetrack this. There was a lot of heat, and we’re now pushing for lots and lots of things to be done. The Democrats control the Senate, a lot of people pushing, and clearly as a way of saying, “I’m doing something,” and “Oh, if we create this commission and it goes away for a year, you don’t have to make me do anything, because I’ll just keep saying that we haven’t heard from the commission yet and we need the commission to do its step.” Absolutely, that is why that commission was created, and when it was first created—again, I’d be curious if Senator Weicker remembers this—Senator Weicker was one of the first people to meet with that commission. I think you have this in your notes. </p>
          <p>It actually was chaired by somebody other than Watkins, initially. You can go back and look at the research, because somebody has the name of that person typed in here. Senator Weicker had me draft his remarks before this commission that basically at one point, I think I remember, it said something like, “I really didn’t want you, we really don’t need you, but now that you’re here, let’s think about how we can work together to advance the needs of the country and the people who are at risk of HIV.” Because Senator Weicker saw it for what it was. </p>
          <p>This was, “We don’t need you. We have the NIH to tell us what we need to do about research, the CDC are experts in education and prevention. We’re not thinking about the health care services; we’ve got people on that. We have government officials whose job it is to tell us what the federal response to the HIV epidemic is going to be. And you guys are just going to be meeting and wasting time while we could actually be—” which is always an interesting thing about commissions. Do you get the agency to do the thing and you go—but then he says nicely at the end, “But here you are and here I am, so why don’t we try to figure out what we can do together?” </p>
          <p>I can’t remember the story about this, but anyway, that chairman leaves and Admiral Watkins, who I think had been named to the commission, takes over as the chair. He’s a much-decorated Navy admiral who knows nothing about this, and it turns out that Admiral Watkins, who also hired a very good executive director for that commission, likes Senator Weicker. They’re different individuals, but Admiral Watkins was an admiral. He believed in the Navy, right? The role the Navy plays in protecting the people. I think he was a man of integrity and principle and heart—and good staff work. [laughter] </p>
          <p>He begins to see the magnitude of the problem, the various components of the problem, and the end of the story is, under his leadership that commission actually issued a very helpful report. The most important thing it did—we have a series of way too many recommendations, they should have targeted it a little bit more, but it said, “We have a series of recommendations, but if you do anything to think about dealing with the HIV epidemic in the late 1980s, you need to deal with discrimination against the people who have the virus, and you need to think about treatment on demand.” </p>
          <p>I thought it was always so interesting, anything that—the other hundreds of recommendations were all public policy, public health, health care services things—that Admiral Watkins basically says if you don’t deal with the way people are discriminated against around this disease—some of this, it matters, but the larger context of discrimination is really problematic. People are not going to be able to access their services, they’re going to be afraid they’re going to lose their kids, they’re going to lose their job. There are all these discriminatory actions that are being taken against the people who are particularly affected. That has serious, serious consequences for how we’re going to be able to deal with the epidemic. And Oh, by the way, this epidemic is exploding in the IV drug community and we don’t have treatment for them. If we can’t get people clean, they’re going to keep using infected needles, and we need to be thinking about ways—</p>
          <p>It turns out they actually did a pretty good thing, even though we were suspicious, rightfully so from the beginning. But Admiral Watkins did a great job, and I often say, Phyllis, that, I think, as a credit to that commission, I believe it’s because they did a very effective job that Congress said, you know what? We now need an independent national commission that can report to us, the Congress. </p>
          <p>This commission that President Reagan created was an executive branch commission. The President created it with an executive order, and its mandate is to advise the President. When Senator Kennedy and Senator Weicker were in the Senate then, in ’88, they basically said in a bill that had a lot of things for people with HIV and AIDS and who were at risk, they created a national commission which was independent of the executive branch, independent of the legislative branch, and basically said to Congress and the White House, “Here’s how the country needs to be thinking about moving forward, because we’re going to be with this for a long, long time. We really do need a strategy for how we’re going to use our resources, how we’re going to be thinking about communities at risk.” And that’s what I wind up being the executive director of. I often say it’s like they did the survey course and we did the 200- or 300-level course. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How much time intervened? I’m not sure I have the timing right in my head—in fact, I know I don’t—between the work that you were doing on the bill to get emergency funding and the establishing of the presidential commission? You said it was sort of put in place to sidetrack you. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So is the timing of those things very close? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes. You know in some ways—no, it’s interesting. That was the Reagan commission. They certainly were doing good things when the staff asked me for information or some of the colleagues that I worked with in the advocacy world, but to be honest with you, I’m pretty sure we just carried on. They did their thing; we did ours. We had the checkbook; we could keep it balanced. By then Senator Weicker is in the minority. But he was always perceived as a leader on that, so no, we just kept funding the NIH, and funding the CDC, and if this commission came out with something good, we would use that, and if it got something bad, we would probably try to—no, we didn’t. No, my recollection is we just let it do its thing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, but if nothing else, that commission gave some recognition of the problem at the executive level of government, and that would have to be important in its own right. Even if all the recommendations ended up being watered down or whatever, it’s a clear acknowledgment that we really have a major, major crisis that needs to be—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Oh yes. Absolutely. Right. Nothing like an admiral standing up in front of the President and the country, saying, “In all my years as an admiral—” Admiral Watkins has quotes that I can’t do accurately, so I want to be careful, but he sort of says all the things he’s confronted in his career as an admiral in terms of the challenges to the United States or a threat to the United States, he then says nothing have I ever seen like HIV. </p>
          <p>The commission did a good job, Phyllis, but I would say in my perspective, for the record, I think that Lowell Weicker is the person who got the Congress to get the White House to get the government to do something about AIDS. These are institutions that appropriate money and all that kind of stuff. I would say the same thing about Admiral Watkins. That commission did an effective job in the end, but it’s because Admiral Watkins was the chair. So I hope to this day that they’re both taking some credit for it, and as I said, very good staff work. But Admiral Watkins knew how to use, like Senator Weicker did in the Senate, his position of leverage and power. He wore his stars. He talked about his role as the admiral. Very effective. He deserves a lot of credit. Again, remember this is ’87, ’88. A lot of people are on board now that we have to be doing something. But it was very helpful and I would give him all the credit for it. Polly Gault was his staff person. She was great. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Say that again. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Polly Gault, G-A-U-L-T was the primary staff person. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>She did a great job. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I want to get into, as well, the issues of special education and higher education. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Can I tell you one more good Weicker HIV story? And then we should switch to that. But I wouldn’t worry too much about running out of time, because there are some other folks who can tell you better about education. I wound up being a health—I did do the whole bill. I can talk a little bit about those education things, but— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, okay, then we don’t need to talk about it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>You’ll get some other people who can fill you in pretty well on the education piece. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay, fine. I’d much rather stay on the issues that you want to stay on.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="012852"></a>1:28:52</p>
          <p class="c-header">Paying for AZT and other AIDS medications</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I just want to tell another story because I think it’s emblematic of the qualities you were talking about before, and I know you have it because it was in the notes. In September 1986, when Senator Weicker takes the Labor, HHS bill to the floor to spend some money on the NIH, and I think that was the year we did the CDC and the Helms language and that kind of stuff, that’s when he learns, literally in that time when we have the bill on the floor, that they’re going to break the AZT [azidothymidine] trial. The AZT trial I think then had about five thousand people in it and it was a double-blind study, so you didn’t know, obviously, who was taking the AZT and who wasn’t. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Is this through the NIH, the AZT study? Okay great.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>The NIH, yes. Burroughs Wellcome was the maker of the drug, but NIH had the study going on with AZT. In ways that I won’t share with you, Weicker gets word that they’re going to break the trial. People are getting better, and the ethics are such that they don’t keep going when they realize that half the group is having a dramatically different outcome. It turns out they can tell it’s not the placebo, it’s the— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Just to be clear, when you say “break the trial,” they’re going to stop the investigation. Okay, sure.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Right. They’re going to stop this. Clearly something’s working, we have a life-threatening illness, and we’re going to break the trial. So right, we’re going to stop it. Senator Weicker gets wind of this, and this is very exciting. We now know AZT—it’s a horrible drug, but it worked, and it was going to do something. AZT works, and now we’re going to be thinking about making it available to—the clinical trial is going to be stopped and everybody and his brother is going to want to be getting AZT, except for the fact that it cost $10,000-$12,000 a year, which is a lot of money today. It was a real, real lot of money back then. It was going to cost that much for people to be able to get the drug. </p>
          <p>Senator Weicker actually realized initially, too, that we might actually charge people who are in this trial to pay for the drug. So there was a first-order step where I know he was like, “Okay this is crazy. We’ve got to cover the cost of the drug for these people. They were in the trial, for goodness sakes. We learned because of them. They can’t be expected to do this.” And remember, lots of these people don’t have insurance. They lost their job, they’re sick with full-blown AIDS, so they’ve lost their health insurance and they’re ineligible. They haven’t lived long enough to qualify for disability and for Medicare, and Medicaid is women and kids. They clearly don’t have insurance. So anyway, long story short, we figure out, “Oh my goodness. There needs to be some mechanism for helping people who have AIDS to pay for this drug if they otherwise don’t have a way to do that.”</p>
          <p>Weicker and I talk about this. I can’t remember the date. You can look if these years are ’86 or ’87, but we’re trying to figure out how to do that. Where’s the money come from? How would you pay for it? What would you do? I discover, with the help of someone—I should be able to give credit to somebody, but I can’t remember. Somebody reminds me that there is in the law something called the Public Health Emergency Provision. It exists in law. In a public health crisis, if the Secretary of HHS or the Surgeon General—my memory is fuzzy—declares a public health emergency, it frees up $30 million. You know, if the bridge falls down, we find money for that. It basically says that you have to get the government official with health authority to declare the emergency. If that gets triggered—so we figure out a way to get it declared a public health emergency, and the $30 million becomes available. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s not the Surgeon General who has to declare the emergency? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>It’s either that or the Secretary of HHS, and I can’t remember which. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Doesn’t Koop declare an emergency at some point? Isn’t it Everett Koop? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes, he’s somebody within the Reagan administration who was alone on a lot. It’s possible it was the Surgeon General. If it becomes important at some point in time I’m sure I have it in my notes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m sure we can find it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Well, this is a little bit—this is what was so great, because nobody remembered this provision existed and so we were able to get the $30 million. We then designed a program for how the dollars would be allocated out to the states to develop a program to make resources available to those who need AZT. Again, it’s not one of those things where you say 50 states divided by—no, some states were disproportionately affected. I mean, this is a stopgap measure, one time only, $30 million. But I saw in your notes that that’s why it actually was slightly controversial because we’re using this public health emergency money to almost create this new drug assistance program that never existed before. </p>
          <p>There were some people who took just a little bit of an issue, there were some people who were troubled by the fact that we were sort of creating a program out of whole cloth, when in fact, maybe there was another process we should have gone through. Then there were other people who just wanted to use it as a way to deny people anything that you would do for AIDS. But I would say it’s Weicker again, this is going to sound so immodest, with good staff work. It was a combination of— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You found the— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>With Senator Weicker saying, “We can’t not help find a way to help people pay for this drug.” It’s fairly expensive. And I love the part where he says, “Certainly the people in the trial. That would be disgraceful.” And then he turns to me and says, “Well, how are we going to do this?” And then we’re able to sort of figure this out, and later it becomes a major provision in the bill that Senator Kennedy and Senator Weicker and others pass. </p>
          <p>They create what’s called the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, which was known as the acronym ADAP. It actually did become a pretty significant part of how in the late ’80s, mid-’90s—I’m not sure how it works, if it works today—programs were created to at least help people have access to the very, very, very limited drugs that were available to people with HIV. But using his position, finding out about the emergency, learning that timing was incredible. Here we had the bill and all of a sudden he’s being told that in a week this may be needed and being able to turn on a dime and do it. He had a very, very good sense of timing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, well clearly that was very true in the Watergate issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Very good sense. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, and also it sounds like he was able to work prodigiously hard on these issues at the same time, to sort of keep his finger on the trigger all the time. Was Senator Kennedy an advocate through this whole process?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Oh yes, he was a partner. I would describe him as a strong advocate. I would describe Lowell Weicker and Ted Kennedy as really close partners on these issues. I don’t know if anyone has pointed this out to you, but again, I would say this is what I thought—I don’t know how often in life this happens, and I think it’s so wonderful.</p>
          <p>Senator Weicker chaired the Appropriations Subcommittee. He was a member of the Authorizing Committee. There’s a Labor and Human Resources Committee, which is in the notes, which Senator Kennedy is the chair of, and that’s how Senator Weicker became the Chair of the Subcommittee on the Handicapped. That’s a subcommittee in the authorizing world. So they pass laws, and Appropriations pays, right? We pay for programs that the laws create. The way it’s supposed to go if you really did this by book, is Congress creates programs through the authorizing process that get signed into law, and the Appropriations Committee looks at how much money gets spent on these programs. In my mind, that was always an incredibly powerful spot for Senator Weicker to be in. He’s on the Committee that looks at the programs and laws and he chairs the Subcommittee that pays for them.</p>
          <p>That was a wonderful thing, and it was a very good thing when Senator Kennedy was on the Authorizing Committee and Senator Weicker was on the Appropriations Committee, so when the Democrats gained control of the majority in the Senate in ’86, and then begin their work like in ’87, now you’ve got Senator Kennedy who’s chairing, right? They’re in the majority, a lot of authority over the authorizing process, working really closely with Senator Weicker as an authorizer, getting bills created, which created the National Commission on AIDS and this drug assistance program, and then, what a beautiful thing it is that he’s still the ranking member. </p>
          <p>Senator Weicker’s not the chair of Labor HHS, because the Republicans are in the minority, but he’s still a very influential key person on the appropriations process. So working, authorizing, and appropriations Senator Kennedy and Lowell Weicker in that way, and then Senator Kennedy and Lowell Weicker as a team on the Authorizing Committee. Because eventually, even though the Democrats had control of the House in ’87, Ronald Reagan was still the President of the United States and you had to get this stuff signed into law. </p>
          <p>Now you’ve got the Democrats in the House, Democrats in the Senate, Senator Weicker in the minority, but a very close colleague of anyone who’s thinking about health and civil rights issues, actually, and education issues in late ’80s. I would say that he and Senator Kennedy were powerful, powerful forces on all three of those things in the late ’80s and on. But if you think about my time, education, health, and civil rights, a lot went on in those days of Senator Weicker and Senator Kennedy. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And were there other people that you would particularly mention who helped promote these policies? Particularly as related to HIV/AIDS and education, I would say?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes. Tom Harkin. I would say Tom Harkin was a really important person in all of this, education as well. On some of these other issues there was somebody else I was just going to mention who popped into my head. I just always have to say that Senator Hatfield as the chair of the Appropriations Committee used his role as the chair of the full Committee, and then eventually the ranking when the Democrats took over, to be the wind in our sails. Senator Weicker took the lead and Senator Hatfield I think appreciated that, but he backed him. I think it’s important that it was someone like Mark Hatfield who was the chairman of the full Committee, and then as we move through those things. Those are the people who come to my mind. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. Now, what kind of work did you do to prepare what eventually became the Americans with Disabilities Act? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Mostly I know that because of HIV. People with HIV and AIDS, people with full-blown AIDS become disabled. I was with Senator Weicker and with the staff that looked a lot at—when he was chair of the Subcommittee on the Handicapped, and then looked at disability issues. It was that staff that really worked the most closely with him to get the Americans with Disabilities Act. He should be well recognized as an early leader—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I know. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>—in that act. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you don’t see yourself as having been fundamental to that work? The act passes of course when he’s no longer in the Senate, but I think most people recognize that the foundation work for it was due to him. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>No. Right. Oh, yes. It was him. I would say the only thing about me then is at that time, the person who staffed him on the Subcommittee on the Handicapped, Kim as the legislative director, me as the Labor HHS person, there may be others, but there was a group of us who for all intents and purposes were just supporting that overall agenda. So I was doing it through appropriations, Terry Muilenburg was doing it through the Subcommittee on the Handicapped, and Kim was so pivotal in so many other ways. I was not the primary point person on the Americans with Disabilities Act. But, it was like a family, we all sort of— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You said Terry. So who is Terry? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Muilenburg. I’m hoping you’re going to interview her? M-U-I-L-E-N-B-U-R-G. She worked for Senator Weicker when he left the Senate, in his Governor’s office here in D.C., and she did the investigation of the state mental hospitals with me. She staffed him on the Subcommittee on the Handicapped. She’d be a very good person. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Great. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>She worked actually as a staff person on Labor HHS at one point too. She’s interacted with him in a number of different capacities. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. That’s great information. Are there more things you want to say about the AIDS and HIV issues and your role in the office and what seemed to you to be particular highlights of your time there, or particular challenges? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes, I guess I would just—well, obviously it was a hugely important—it shaped my thinking about how I spent the rest of my life professionally. But it was built on a foundation. I worked at Hassle House, you know. [laughs]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Way back when. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I was always drawn to those sorts of areas and it just happened. I always say to people in some ways I wish my life—I wish the HIV epidemic had not existed. It’s an unbelievable tragedy that people still live with today. It’s a terrible, terrible virus that we don’t have a cure for. And it was painful, emotionally painful, to be struggling as hard as we were struggling to try to get resources into the hands of people who could either think about cures, or frankly, knew drugs that would address the opportunistic infections, which is what was killing people, not the underlying virus. And then trying to professionally think about how to structure the health care system to be under the weight of that. Around the world in some ways, but we were only focused on domestic.</p>
          <p>They were mean, ugly, demoralizing times—not demoralizing, because I always felt, thank goodness, we were doing it. I must have said that to Senator Weicker a couple of times. That’s how it shaped me in some ways. I like to win, but I don’t have to win to be in the fight. It’s rewarding to me to know that what I’m doing that day is trying to get people’s fundamental human rights respected or the public health epidemic addressed, or I learned in that time that what matters to me is speaking out and being counted, and I want to win. But if I don’t win, it’s not the end of the game for me. We didn’t win a lot in the early days, and it was sad. It just made me sad. </p>
          <p>But I worked for someone who understood how to fight for people and shared—that’s why I like him—my belief in the role of government when it comes to people’s basic rights, and when it comes to the narrow role we have about public health. We didn’t talk too much about it, but higher education and those kinds of things. I just strongly believe in it, and I liked being a part of that, as I said before at the AIDS Commission. It’s why I liked being at the AIDS Commission. We would hear terrible stories, and I can’t fix that person’s family, I can’t fix that person’s tribe, I can’t fix that person’s religion. But the government does not get to discriminate against him or her. Does not get to take a pass on whether or not in fact we’re going to fund this program. Holding the government accountable through the Constitution, as Weicker would say, and protecting people’s rights, but also programmatically, there is a role for the government. </p>
          <p>I just have an incredible passion about it, and I’m sure that got reinforced by working with someone like Senator Weicker. I know my skills got developed, and most of my good skills got developed by making a lot of mistakes. I’m a much better negotiator. I think my sense of timing is better than it would’ve been if I hadn’t been around Senator Weicker. It’s like any leadership book you’ve ever read. If you want to learn to be a leader, hang around with one. Just you watch and see how that goes and then take it on yourself. </p>
          <p>HIV and AIDS and fighting during that time moved me in a way that very few things before or since have, although there have been some others. I feel passionate about foster care issues and some other things, such gay rights. That’s why I’m working on gay rights now. I just fundamentally think, when you don’t accept someone for who they fundamentally are—I can’t fix everybody. I can’t fix the church, I can’t fix the tribe, I can’t fix the family. I just don’t think the government gets to discriminate against them. I sort of feel that same feeling right now. So many issues of what I think people are entitled to as legitimate citizens of the United States. </p>
          <p>It reinforced a passion in me. I always say to people I always want to use my head on things that move my heart, that I’ve discovered that moved my heart in really important ways. And then I just got incredible professional skills working around somebody like Senator Weicker and reinforcing the belief in the government. Believing that elected officials should be held accountable, and believing that that process is legitimate and should be advanced. It’s just stayed with me. </p>
          <p>I’ve had other people since Senator Weicker. The vice-chair of the National Commission on AIDS was very influential in my life for things that you would not necessarily learn on the Hill. He taught me a lot about people coming from very, very different points of view and how you figure out where the common cause is. In the Senate it’s about getting the votes, you know. It’s good to get them. So anyway, I’m rambling. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I have a couple of questions about Senator Weicker. One specific—you said there were times that this made you just very sad, so I’m wondering if Senator Weicker himself had ways of dealing with staff to help them deal with their sadness or to motivate or whatever? That’s one question, and the other is a more general one, just what it was like to work with him day in and day out. He’s a pretty strongly opinionated person and very direct, and you know I’ve had my own conversations with him. I can sort of see that personality, so I just wonder if you could address those? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>My overwhelming experience with him during that time and as his staff person was one where you actually did not show or share a lot of emotion. I actually think he has a heart the size of Texas, and on some things he is a real softie. But I think you have to get to know him pretty well or go through some pretty challenging experience with him, maybe where you would get that. </p>
          <p>I feel like I know him like that now. I’ve seen a really warm side. If you see him talk to children, and I hate to say this, but particularly disfigured kids who were disabled in some fashion, oh my God. I mean he just knows, he’s moved by them, but the way he talks to them, and he’ll literally say, “What a handsome young man,” consciously using the word handsome. We saw a lot of that when we were doing our work. I saw that, but to give you a shorter answer to your question, I think it’s fair to say you didn’t deal with a lot of emotional stuff. It was about— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The work. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>—getting the work done. And they were human beings. We never lost the—Senator Weicker doesn’t like acronyms. He doesn’t like you referring to something by the PL number because words matter. So I think he always knew that this was about people, but it was about the work, and in a really good way. Tough love, you know. When you’re doing the Labor HHS bill, you’re going to cut some programs that would break your heart, Phyllis. But at the end of the day, I remember him chastising me at one point when I think I sighed under my breath or something. “Oh there goes another one.” I’m pretty sure he said, “Don’t ever do that again. Our job is the limited resources we have—” </p>
          <p>He was all business about the people’s bill. I think in some ways you have to be because otherwise you might not be able to make tough choices, because you can’t give everybody everything they want, and everybody deserves what they’re asking for in the Labor HHS bill, right? Sick children, old people, sick people. But you have to make some choices and I think he had a good sense of how if you got too caught up in the emotion of it, that might not allow you to do the job. I think he had the same feeling about that. You sort of toughed it out. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But day in and day out, you found him— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>So this is how do you work with him? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Is he good to work with? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Yes. He was tough to work with. I would say he was tough to work with, demanding. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you were very young. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I was very young, but I learned fast. “Don’t like it that way.” <em>Okay, I am never going to do that again.</em> But you don’t say that at all. You’re just like, “Sorry.” [laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You must have had a certain toughness to be able to hang in there and— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>You cared about the outcome so much, lots of times you just didn’t take it personally because it was about—if he was mad at you, you didn’t get the thing right because that kid can’t get helped. You didn’t get the thing right because we’re not going to get the bill to the floor. It’s not because—when he would be angry or impatient, yes, I will tell you. The first year I did the Labor HHS bill—oh gosh, I haven’t thought about this story in such a long time—we had these public witness hearings where people come and they can petition the government, the things I talked to you about. I was new, and in my defense, I relied on someone’s recommendation about how many of those people we could actually have testify over the course of an hour, an hour and fifteen minutes. [brief discussion about blinking light on recorder] </p>
          <p>I’m not going to end on this story because I want to end on another one in some fashion. I don’t tell this story very often.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well I also have a final question, so I don’t think it will be— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Okay. I don’t tell this very often, but, oh my God. The hearing starts at like 9:30, the public witness hearings start at 11:00, and we’re supposed to be done by 12:00. But this is roughly about right. Twelve o’clock comes, we have maybe 20 more people, maybe 25. I mean, more people, more people, more people. When I told this story in the past, I used to say, “Oh my God, you know I was sitting there thinking,” and he was furious at me. Just furious. We are now at the hearing two hours longer than we had budgeted in his calendar. I’m sure he had other things that had to happen. He is furious. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Furious at you for allowing all these people to come? Or what did you do?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>What, I didn’t organize it? Well, they could come tomorrow. You have a series. You have to schedule people in a— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>You have this many people and this amount of time, how many days you have to do? “Rocket science? I think not,” he’s saying to himself. [laughs] I had never done it before. So this woman says, “Oh yes, we can do all these. Fine.” But I’m—this is classic Senator Weicker too, and I actually think this is right, he doesn’t care how this happened, and I’m in charge, I’m the staff director, it’s my job. Buck stops here, right?  And of course you know how this works, like he’s sitting in the chair and I’m in this little chair next to him and he is furious at me, just furious at me. </p>
          <p>I used to tell people that I used to pray that the hearings would come to an end. Then about 45 minutes in, I prayed it would never end. Never. Because I knew he was going to be so angry at me. And sure enough when it is over he doesn’t look at me, just leaves the room. I doubt he remembers this. He leaves the room, goes back. I figure I am in big trouble, and I’m giving the person a hard time, “What were you thinking? How could you possibly—?”</p>
          <p>Sure enough, “BUZZ”—“Senator Weicker wants to see you.” [laughs] He was very angry at me. But here’s what he said. “What!? This is—” I mean he was very angry at me, not mincing any words. But what he said was he said, “Maureen, those people think they’re coming to talk to the government. We can’t just—they need to feel like someone's listening. They need to feel heard.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it wasn’t about him and his time and—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Not that time, anyway. [laughs] You could tell him I said that. But I remembered it because I’m smart enough at that point, I’m just like, Never again. Won’t happen. No defense. You don’t want to argue back, right? He was right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>But I remembered that his anger with me, in that case at least he was saying, “People want to be heard,” as opposed to, “I was hoping I was going to go play racquetball or something.” I mean that wasn’t what he said. And then there are other times, Phyllis, when, he’s very, very demanding. But it’s the whole package. It’s why he’s as good as he is. It’s why you want to work for him, and it’s a part of who he is. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s legacy</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What you do you think is going to be his greatest legacy for his time in government? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I don’t know how much people understand his defense of the Constitution in the face of inappropriate and bad legislative efforts. He woke up and went to bed I think as someone who just really believed in the Constitution, and it informed so much of what he did as a Senator. You can ask any staff person, “You don’t take a referendum on the Constitution.” It’s like there are certain things that are sacrosanct. Which is why I discovered I had the same feeling when all the torture issues were going on with the Bush administration when I was at Human Rights First. I used to walk around and say, “The Geneva Convention. Even the Geneva Conventions we’re not going to recognize?” </p>
          <p>Weicker so often would be, “The Constitution? We’re just going to trample on the Constitution today?” So I think his fierce defense of the Constitution, and what that protected, informed a lot of his work around civil rights because there were certain constitutional protections. You don’t legislate them away, but you also don’t—you can pass laws that make those protections real for people. I think that’s driven. I believe, I would only hope when all the history books are written, that he will always appear as a very prominent, and I would say leader, on how the federal government really did respond to the HIV epidemic. </p>
          <p>It’s a complicated story because it was done indirectly. It was through the appropriations process. He didn’t stand up and pass an AIDS bill and declare this was now the decade of HIV. In some ways, and I would say this was really big of Senator Weicker, in some ways it’s almost a behind-the-scenes role of forcing the government to take money, to find answers that other people came around to later. I really think if Lowell Weicker had not been the chairman of that subcommittee, the NIH, the CDC, all of the appropriate public health service agencies would have taken even longer to try to figure this out. And we’d be that much further behind in drug development and vaccine development and prevention health care services for people who were sick. So I think—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The data does show that year after year, Congress essentially doubled the appropriations for HIV and other social programs that the Reagan administration in particular was proposing, which is pretty fascinating. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>And he chaired the – </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you’re – </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>That’s him. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And your claim is that he should be remembered for basically—that it was done behind-the-scenes in this way is supported by the way in which that money got appropriated, and consistently year after year. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Oh yes, it was a predictable dance. In came the budget, decimating some, cutting others, Senator Weicker saying, “Okay, there will be no cuts, now let's talk about what the incremental increases will be.” I’d say in some ways that may be a legacy too that the record hopefully will reflect. I guess I could say it this way: Not only did the Reagan agenda for social programs and health get thwarted by Senator Weicker, he actually advanced some things at a time when that administration would have liked to have eliminated them. Yes, I guess maybe people would say that’s an overstatement. </p>
          <p>There’s a Department of Education. I think he’s really very responsible for why it did not go away and get morphed back into HEW [Health, Education, and Welfare] or something. There were advances in mental health research because they didn’t actually have to stop for six or seven years during the Reagan administration. I mean, what the administration was trying to do domestically, because horrible things still happened, so I’m tripping all over myself to say if you still looked back on those eight years, I think a lot happened to the social contract and the social welfare agenda that I think is appropriate for the federal government to be involved in. You could argue how much, but I think fundamental roles are sort of important. We took a lot of hits, and Senator Weicker, I’m sure, talks a lot about that, but it could have been— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So much worse. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>So much worse, and in some cases, he advanced the ball. We increased the NIH spending, we didn’t just level fund it. It got increased. And we responded to an epidemic. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We haven’t even talked about William Bennett, but I think a lot of that’s on record. So that’s, I think, very valuable, what you’ve just said. And it’s interesting, because in my discussion yesterday with Bill Shure he would argue that Lowell Weicker will most be remembered for Watergate. That’s what will always hit the textbooks, but I think what you’ve just said about defense of the Constitution ties all of that together, and it’s really the same impulse that is motivating his concern with Watergate. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>He would not necessarily—an imperial presidency. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>You’re not above the law. I think that’s—yes. That’s why you asked before too, but that’s where I think he is who he is as a human being, and he grew up to be who he is, but that’s why I think the rights of the vulnerable—in many ways he gets that’s the—and it gets played out in lots of different ways. So good on gay rights issues, so good on disability rights, good on women’s choice issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The environment. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>The environment. I don’t know what the next issue or constituency is, but it’s that he sees unfairness, and the Constitution is supposed to, the government is supposed to be that place where you don’t just get to treat people any which way, you know? To completely say it in casual terms, but I think it is sort of how it plays itself out. His belief and passion for science, I’m not sure where that comes from. I think it’s because actually in some ways he’s quite intellectual. But he has a real passion for science. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay, now this really has nothing to do with your time in government, but it does have something to do with your larger experience, and is no doubt an unfair question, but I’m too curious not to ask it, which is, what do you think is the relationship between the kind of work that Lowell Weicker did and the health care bill that just passed? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Oh, I hope he feels two things about it. Too bad we can’t do universal coverage at this moment in time. He’s someone who always I think has a very good grasp of the larger context and ultimately what the right structure would be. But I hope he has an enormous amount of pride in the fact that there’s a law now that essentially says everyone in this country should have—not that everybody is covered by this law, that’s why I had to preface it with my other— but the law of the land says health care coverage for everyone, and a significant part of that bill talks about the importance of public health and prevention, and that was informed by an organization that he currently chairs. This he deserves along with others. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>By what organization?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>He chairs an organization called Trust for American’s Health.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>It’s a public health advocacy organization. And in the spirit of full disclosure, I helped create it when I worked at the Pew Charitable Trusts. But it was a significant player as the health care bill was being put together to include in addition to health insurance coverage, a significant investment in public health and prevention activities. And that organization had a lot to do with the public health and prevention activities. It would support all of the other coverage. But for Senator Weicker to feel like there now is a law that recognizes that, it’s based on a value that everyone's entitled to health coverage. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Well, it seems to me actually regardless of the current role that he plays, that the very values that you’ve been talking about in this interview have finally been recognized now in this national health care bill. At least in terms of a general principle, no matter how flawed the bill is and how hard it was to get it through. And a whole other set of issues not for this interview has to do with the nature of Congress, as well, and whether the kind of work that he did when he did it could even be done today. But, nonetheless, the passage of the health care bill is finally, I think, a recognition of, as you said, the rights of all Americans to have some kind of basic health care and issues of disability and handicapped and AIDS and all of that, you know has to be part of this larger principle. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>I think that’s right. I would share with you that what I’m doing now does not limit itself to looking at health care reform. To go back to the point about we’ve come very, very far, but we’re not there yet. I’m working with a lot of gay organizations that, among many things that they’re trying to do, will now try to be sure that as that health care reform act is implemented, families are covered to include their children. Services that are needed will respect same-sex couples. </p>
          <p>I suppose that for me, that bill is such an advance in the way that you described it, but for those of us who are always looking out for, making sure that everybody’s covered, there’s always work to be done because, at least for many gay individuals, I would say, there are still programs where you have to—because there are issues still with marriage and whether you get benefits and who’s a spouse and all those kinds of things. So there’s a discrimination thing in society that we’re hoping gets addressed, obviously, in the government, but it comes up in places like this. But lots and lots of people get covered who—that’s the beauty of it, right? I mean 30 million people with the sign of a pen get covered. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I can’t thank you enough for this. This has really been fantastic, and I so appreciate your openness and just sharing as much as you have. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>Oh well, it’s a pleasure. I value oral histories. I should tell you when I was at Pew Charitable Trust he had an oral history program for some of our biomedical scholars. So the purpose of oral histories I’ve always found to be really important and compelling and I’m delighted that UVA is thinking as thoughtfully and as aggressively as they are about not only preserving, but maybe promoting his legacy a little bit. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, okay, thank you so much. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">M. Byrnes: </span>It’s a pleasure. </p>
