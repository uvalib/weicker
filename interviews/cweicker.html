          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is Phyllis Leffler. The date is April 27, 2010. I am in the Harrison Small Library with Claudia T. Weicker for an interview in the Lowell Weicker Oral History series. Good morning. Thank you for being here.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Thank you, Phyllis.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000031"></a>0:00:31</p>
          <p class="c-header">Claudia Weicker’s early life and Catholic upbringing</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’d like to start out by just asking you to talk a little bit about your personal background and a little bit about your educational background before you took your first job. But if you could just tell us a little bit about where you were born, anything important, you think, about your early years, and then a little bit about your educational background, that would be great.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Happy to. I was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and raised in the suburbs of Hartford, in West Hartford, Connecticut. My parents lived in the same house I think for more than 40, almost 50 years, in a nice suburban area. My background is that I am second-generation Italian on all sides. All of my grandparents were immigrants to the United States. My mother’s family settled in Hartford. My father’s family ultimately in Kansas City, Missouri, and sometime during the late ’20s or early ’30s, my father, who did a summer circuit as a racecar driver, wound up in Hartford and met my mother, and all the rest was history. </p>
          <p>I was raised Catholic. My mother was a devout Catholic. My father was Catholic, but I think a little less devout. [laughter] I think he managed to skip a few masses every now and then, but we were sent to parochial school. It’s very interesting, because in the early years of their marriage, my parents lived, first, in Hartford, and when they decided to build a house, they built in West Hartford, which was a rapidly growing more middle class, upper middle class suburb. To the day he died my father always said that the reason why he built his house in West Hartford was because it had at the time not just the best school system in Connecticut, but the best public school system in the country. </p>
          <p>And he drilled into us the fact that he saw—and he voted for every education referendum that ever came up in the town—that the value of his property was directly tied to how well the town took care of its children, so that was my first introduction. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And that’s important in terms of later issues.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes it is. I mean he absolutely drilled this into us, but on the other hand, they sent us to parochial school all our life [laughter], so there was a little bit of an inconsistency there, but I think my mother wanted us to have the Catholic education with the nuns. They were nuns at the time. Very few lay teachers at that time in the schools.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000422"></a>0:04:22</p>
          <p class="c-header">Early interest in politics</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I remember my first recollection of a political discussion. These took place at dinnertime. We always had dinner as a family and there were always discussions about what was going on in the world at dinner. I don’t know whether this was before or after Walter Cronkite. I sometimes remember seeing the news, but I don’t think I paid very much attention to it. I suspect we had dinner after the evening news, but I remember the first discussion, really, was of the 1952 presidential election, and it was election day. My father was furious when he found out that my mother voted for Dwight Eisenhower. He was a Democrat, although interestingly, neither of my parents actively participated, other than voting. They exercised their political, their constitutional responsibility, but they never directly participated in politics.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, my mother’s sister, who was my godmother, was actively involved in Democratic politics, and I think through her and through friends I met in high school whose families were more directly involved, I became involved. I was interested in the subject from a young age, but I had the opportunity when I was in high school to work after school at the [John F.] Kennedy headquarters on Main Street in Hartford and I went down at least three days a week, maybe more, to stuff envelopes, sometimes work into the evening doing phoning, going over registration lists, identifying Democratic voters, doing very basic political work, the kind of thing that everybody does in a campaign and still does.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did the Kennedy campaign in particular inspire you, or—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, I think it did. I think given my background that I was Catholic, number one, that John Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy were a much more attractive couple; younger people could identify with them. The concept of this great big Irish Catholic family that seemed to have a good time when they were together was probably inspirational, but more importantly, I felt from age 14 I was a Democrat, and we had actually followed the primaries in Connecticut. I remember the primary in West Virginia clearly. I remember the results when Kennedy beat [Hubert] Humphrey. Ironically, after college, I would go to Washington and work in the Humphrey campaign in 1968, but in 1960 I was very much involved in the Kennedy campaign.</p>
          <p>The only thing that actually irritated me was that my mother—John Kennedy was coming to Hartford, and in those days there were still great public rallies, something which we’ve just recently gotten back to, but there were great public rallies. Candidates would come to the balcony of the Hartford Times building and there’d be masses in the street to listen to them. Kennedy was coming, but my mother would not sign a permission slip to let me leave school to go and see him. I remember coming home from school that afternoon and she wasn’t home. She came back saying, “Oh, he was just wonderful.” So she had gone down there [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But school came first.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>But school came first. So that really is my early introduction to politics.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You went to Fordham University?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No. I went to Marymount College—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Marymount, I’m sorry.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>—which was an independent school run by the Sisters of, I guess, St. Mary, and there were several Marymounts. There was one in Arlington, which at the time was a junior college. There was Marymount in Manhattan, Marymount in Tarrytown, which was really the flagship school, and that’s where I went to school. I graduated from Marymount in Tarrytown. I actually went to a local junior college first. I went to a school called Hartford College for Women, which is now part of the University of Hartford. Hartford College was started in the ’30s. It actually was started during the Depression as a place for young women to attend college and have two years of college. </p>
          <p>It was sometimes called Mount Holyoke in Hartford because the original teaching staff came from Mount Holyoke. They would travel to Hartford I don’t know how many days a week for classes, and then it expanded to include professors from Mount Holyoke and Smith and Trinity and Amherst. It had basically a little Ivy League flavor and certainly wonderful, wonderful professors. Even when I was there in the ’60s it still drew its professorial staff from all of these great schools. </p>
          <p>I did ultimately want to go away to college, but I was sensitive to the fact that it would be a burden for my parents if I went for four years, and this seemed like the legitimate compromise here. I had access to a really first-class education in Hartford and I could then go away my last two years.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you lived at home? And saved the cost.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I lived at home and I became even more involved actually politically during those years. I worked on Senator Tom Dodd’s re-election campaign in 1964, and that’s when I first knew Senator Chris Dodd. Chris is about a year, I think, older than I am, maybe two, and we got to know each other. He at the time was dating a very good friend of mine, and so we saw each other frequently. That’s the first time I met a President of the United States, too. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who was—?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Lyndon Johnson. When he came to campaign in Hartford, I was there with Senator Dodd, and I remember when he shook my hand it was the biggest hand I had ever seen. I was a very impressionable, I guess, 17-year-old at the time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>There were three or four of us who went everywhere with Senator Dodd when he made campaign appearances and we handed out buttons and we handed out flyers and bumper stickers and did all of those things. We were so-called Dodd Girls [laughter] wearing little white dresses and red, white, and blue ribbons.</p>
          <p>And then in my years at Hartford College, I joined an organization called the Connecticut Intercollegiate Student Legislature. It was a club and had membership from all of the universities throughout Connecticut and it was primarily political. We would meet monthly with members from other schools, from Trinity, from Yale, from Wesleyan, from Bridgeport University, from Fairfield, from Connecticut State University, and we would discuss a legislative program. One weekend a year, I think in early March, we would take over the capitol in Connecticut and have a mock legislature, a house and senate. We would elect our own leaders and present legislation, and at that time, at one of those mock sessions, I ran the campaign for a young man from Fairfield University who won as speaker of the house. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You were gaining a lot of experience before you ever entered—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And then the young man who was also part of our ticket who was elected as president of the senate ironically was in the State senate when Lowell became Governor. So there’re a lot of crossovers.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s very interesting. So you would’ve been at Hartford College for Women—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>1964 to ’66. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, and then you went on to Marymount.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And then I went on to Marymount and I graduated from Marymount in ’68, so I spent two years at Marymount in Tarrytown.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay, and then in 1968, you go to work for the Humphrey campaign?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>That’s right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And when you’re doing that, it seems, I gather that you are focused specifically on the southern states in terms of—and therefore got involved with a number of the civil rights activities that were going on in the South.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes, I did. That was my principal responsibility.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did you travel to the South a lot?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I didn’t go to the South. I talked with people every day in the South. We had our contacts. The way the campaign was structured with the four regions—East, West, the middle Atlantic, the middle states, and then the southern states, and then subdivided into two sections within each region, I had the Deep South—Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Alabama and Georgia, and there was really very little hope, with the possible exception of Florida, that Humphrey would carry any of those states. The campaign was short of cash at any rate, and wanted to spend as little as possible in those states, yet it was the first year that the Voting Rights Act was effective in a presidential election. </p>
          <p>I was given a list of contacts in each of the states, which included the Democratic state chairman and committee people, and in a number of states I was also in contact with civil rights leaders, especially in Mississippi. In Mississippi I talked regularly with Hodding Carter, whose family had the Cleveland, Mississippi, newspaper. I can’t remember the name of it. It may have been the Delta Times. I can’t remember.</p>
          <p>I talked daily with Hodding and I talked virtually every day with other civil rights leaders there, including Charles Evers, who was the head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Mississippi, and Aaron Henry, and once in a while I talked with Fannie Hamer, so it was a real education for me. But what was important was we wanted to know how voter registration drives were going in those states, whether there was any significant effort to impede the registration of black Americans in voting, and what kind of effort they were putting together to get out the vote. </p>
          <p>In October, I believe it was, of 1968, I was sitting at my desk one day and I received a telephone call from Charles Evers. He had accepted an invitation earlier to speak that evening on the campus of Ole Miss, to the Young Democrats at Ole Miss, and he called me and said that he had just received a telephone call from the Governor’s office informing that if he stepped foot on campus, he would be arrested immediately.</p>
          <p>I think I had just turned 22 years old, and I was sitting at my desk and I thought, <em>Okay, now, I think this is what you’re here for</em> [laughter] so I immediately went and talked with my supervisor and then we went—Senator Fred Harris from Oklahoma was one of the campaign chairmen and he happened to be sitting in his DNC [Democratic National Committee] office that day. We went and talked with him and then they went and talked with Larry O’Brien. A telephone call was immediately put into the Justice Department and ultimately Charles Evers did speak that night. He was surrounded by federal marshals when he went to the campus at Ole Miss, but it was an education to me as to how different the world could be. </p>
          <p>I mean this was far different than where I had grown up in nice, quiet West Hartford, Connecticut, and yet it seemed like a wonderful opportunity. In Florida I had a field man, Eddie McCormack, the former attorney general of Massachusetts, who had run against Ted Kennedy in that famous primary in 1962. I talked every day with Eddie McCormack, who was always so enthusiastic about everything that was going on in Florida, always asking for materials. He called me and he said, “I finally received a box of campaign materials. There are holy card–sized photographs of Hubert Humphrey on one side with the Miami Dolphins schedule on the back. “I can use them perhaps to cover one telephone pole.” [laughter] Very soon after that, he called me and he said, “It does not make sense for me to remain in Florida. We’re not going to win here.” So he was moved out, I think, to Maryland.</p>
          <p>In Alabama I talked every day with the chairman of the Democratic Party, whose name was Bob Vance, and obviously Alabama was totally lost to [George] Wallace from the very beginning and he was very matter of fact. He said, “You know, you really don’t need to waste a lot of time on us.” But it was this other part, “And, yes, we’re proceeding to register people,” etc. The significance of Bob Vance is that he was one of the federal judges who was killed by the Unabomber years later. It was a real shock to me when I realized who it was.</p>
          <p>And then in Tennessee, and I don’t know why I had contact with Tennessee, but I did. I think I was covering for my partner in the region, but one of the people we talked to all the time was John Seigenthaler. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And that is ironic, given the fact that he was from the newspaper family. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>But I suppose so was Hodding Carter. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It sounds to me—correct me if I’m wrong—that all of that gives you quite a bit of exposure to the challenges of winning elections, but also to the diversity of the country, and so once you get involved with Congress, you probably have a much better sense of what other Senators and members of Congress are dealing with within their own districts. Do you feel that you carried that experience with you as you went forward?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I think there’s no doubt about it, because later on when I worked in the Senate, I worked primarily on committees, They’re made up of Senators from all over, and while your first responsibility may be to your subcommittee chairman and your full committee chairman, you’re really responsible to all the members of the committee. You work for everyone, and I worked with people as diverse as John Glenn from Ohio, who came from an industrial state. Obviously, Lowell Weicker and Abe Ribicoff from Connecticut. I knew Connecticut. Connecticut is very mixed, and at that time, I suppose, I don’t think we used the term as much, but liberal state, progressive maybe more so. And Jim Allen from Alabama, who came from a whole different background, he had a whole different set of beliefs and he had a very different constituency that he was representing, and so you have to respect the member for who their constituents are. Even though you may not agree with their policies, you still have to find a way to work with them. </p>
          <p>On the House side, years later when I was on the Appropriations Committee, and particularly Labor, Health &amp; Human Services, the House chairman was Congressman Bill Natcher from Kentucky. He was an institution in the House. He was one of the longest-serving members of the House. He had a very strong ethic. He was courtly in a very southern way, but he was really incredibly well mannered. </p>
          <p>He was far more conservative than either Lowell Weicker or Mark Hatfield, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, but so well mannered that he would always let you discuss things. And yet he, for years, when he had been chairman of the District of Columbia Appropriations Committee and I lived in the District, had held up for years and years and years the D.C. Metro. He was the single person most responsible for the fact that we didn’t build the Metro 10 or 15 years earlier than we ultimately did. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This was Bill Natcher?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Bill Natcher, and in the long run it cost so much more to build it. He obviously was representing a constituency that didn’t want to spend money on those people in the District of Columbia.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you’ve had all this experience as a very young person. You’re obviously very connected to the notion that it’s important to make a difference by getting engaged, but then you actually don’t get engaged right away. You go to work on Wall Street for a number of years.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I did, only because getting that first job on Capitol Hill was very difficult. You either really know someone who—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Or you work for nothing.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, even working for nothing may be difficult, or you get a job as an intern I suppose, and work for nothing. I couldn’t afford to work for nothing. My parents had supported me for a couple of months in Washington during the summer of ’68 when I first visited and started looking for a job, and the Humphrey campaign barely paid me enough to live on, but it did. It paid me enough. </p>
          <p>Then I was unemployed again, so I had to settle—I had interviews on Capitol Hill. I interviewed with Tom Foley. I interviewed with Brock Adams on the House side. I had a couple of interviews, but it’s a chicken and egg situation. In order to get in, they’re looking for someone with experience, and the only place I knew to get experience was to be there working. I saw this just recently with one of our sons who wanted to get a job in government, and ran into the same conundrum. Unless you want to get there and work for free for a while and hope for the best, then it’s hard to break in.</p>
          <p> So a friend whom I had worked with on the Humphrey campaign and came off of Capitol Hill was opening this office for Arthur Lipper Corporation, and then it became a subsidiary of Oppenheimer, and it was research based on activity in Washington. It was market-based research, but it had its twist in that we followed legislative activities, regulatory activities, executive decisions, that could impact the markets. We followed all of the statistics that come up monthly on unemployment, cost of living, etc., so it actually broadened my background. I went to legislative hearings. I got to know legislative staff on the Hill I called with questions, and so I got my experience through the back door.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And now you’re using your economics major with your interest and previous exposure to politics and putting those two together, in a sense growing in terms of your understanding.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Exactly, but I always, always wanted, in the first instance, to be there, to be on the Hill working. And I did enjoy my years working off the Hill. I had some incredible experiences there, too. For instance, in 1972, one of the young men who came on as a member of our firm, which by that time had changed its name to Bradley Woods, was Dick Cheney, and two of our partners had worked in the [Richard] Nixon administration. Obviously Dick had had experience in the Nixon administration. He had just come off of working on the Cost of Living Council in 1972 and his office was right next to mine. I sat day after day in Dick’s office and we watched the Watergate hearings together in 1973. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And they were all his friends and contemporaries who were testifying. The Dwight Chapins and the John Deans were people that were not just work colleagues. They were personal friends.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It must have been fascinating.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, what was fascinating was when it first happened, just a couple of weeks after the Watergate break-in itself, Alan Woods, one of our partners who had come out of the White House, had to go down to the D.C. Courthouse to look up something and he came back to the office and he immediately went into Dick’s office. I was sitting there and he said, “Dick, you know, there might be something more to this Watergate stuff than we realize.” He said, “I was just down at the courthouse and Hugh Sloan got into the elevator with his lawyer and his lawyer wouldn’t let him talk to me.” Hugh Sloan was one of the early people who did the right thing, so I got to see it with Dick, and of course then later Dick went and became Jerry Ford’s Chief of Staff. </p>
          <p>I knew Dick Cheney when he was a moderate. I knew him not just through work. My husband at the time and I, we were social friends. We had dinner at each other’s houses. I remember Dick’s children when they were collecting worms in jars. So what happened to him between the time he left us and ultimately became Vice President is amazing. I mean the person I saw leave the Vice Presidency is nowhere near the person I knew in the early ’70s. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s very interesting. Lots of people, of course, traveled that similar kind of road. We’ve seen it over and over again.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>But I think fundamentally what happened to Dick is that when he became Ford’s Chief of Staff and there was the great surge to reform legislation following Watergate, he saw the executive give up a tremendous amount of authority. You had a couple of Supreme Court decisions. You had [James L.] <span class="court-case">Buckley v.</span> [Francis R.] <span class="court-case">Valeo</span> on the veto, the President’s line item veto basically, and you had the aftermath of Watergate, where Congress was really impacting what had been powers assumed by the executive and putting far more controls on it. I think that was the beginning of Dick’s conservatism, and then he went back to Wyoming and emerged as this conservative congressman. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Hired by Lowell Weicker as legislative assistant</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In 1975 you joined the minority staff of the Subcommittee on Open Government and you’re hired by Lowell Weicker into that position as a legislative assistant.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>That’s right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you have told me all along that you were a strong Democrat, so how is it that you were even interested in going into that job? Was it that it was an entrée into government, or was there something specific about the job or the person already at that point that you knew you wanted to do that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I think it was a combination of things. Number one, I did want to work on the Hill, and it definitely was an entrée to Capitol Hill. Number two, he never asked me if I was a Democrat. I think he assumed I was, but I don’t think Lowell ever asked any of his staff whether they were Republicans or Democrats. I know later when I was hired by Senator Ribicoff that Ribicoff never asked, and he knew I came from a Republican staff, and later on, Senator Hatfield never asked. Obviously, there’re those who do ask, but—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you were hired because of your skills to do the work.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes. Someone believed that I could do that job that was offered and therefore I took it, but part of the reason I think also was it was explained to me that most of the legislation emanating from Watergate would be coming to, at that time it was called the Governmental Affairs Committee, and most of the reform legislation coming out of Watergate would be going through that Committee, and that’s what I would be working on. I would be working less on Subcommittee business, some on Subcommittee business, but more importantly on these full Committee issues that would be coming up, and the Watergate legislation included the financial disclosure legislation, the establishment of a congressional counsel, the special prosecutor legislation. </p>
          <p>The Congressional Budget Act had already been passed. The oversight legislation over the intelligence agencies and the re-organization of congressional oversight itself would be going through the Governmental Affairs Committee, so these were all very current issues and they were big issues and they would be controversial issues and I thought, <em>Gosh, this is baptism by fire</em>. I like this. We also, on the Subcommittee—the reason why the Subcommittee was called the Subcommittee on Open Government was we did the Government in the Sunshine legislation where congressional hearings and meetings and agency meetings would no longer be held behind totally closed doors. Unless there was a serious reason for closing a hearing, they had to be open to the public.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So this is your first exposure to Senator Weicker’s office.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Right.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003850"></a>0:38:50</p>
          <p class="c-header">Becomes minority staff director of Subcommittee on Open Government</p>
<p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And how the office works, and you’re a legislative assistant for—would it be two years before you become the director?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No. I think I became the director within a year. Dick McGowan, who had been Lowell’s press secretary during Watergate, moved over to become the staff director of the Subcommittee when I was first hired, and then Dick left within a year, I think. He left the Committee and I became the staff director of the Subcommittee, minority staff director.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So can you just talk a little bit about how that work got done, who you worked with most closely, how the office itself operated?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>At that time, Bob Dotchin was Lowell’s chief legislative assistant, and I communicated most often and most directly with Bob Dotchin because I still needed his advice on the mechanics of things. He could fill in a little bit of the history of the Senator’s views on items and where he might be coming from so that I was prepared in anything that I wrote for the Senator or would have to present to him as a proposal for a decision that I’d be prepared for whatever view he might take. I mean, if I was suggesting something that might be contrary to his views, I wanted to know it ahead of time and be prepared to defend it, so we had a really close working relationship. </p>
          <p>I had lunch I think most days with Bob Dotchin, who was the legislative director, Jeff Baker, who worked on the Commerce Committee staff for Senator Weicker, and a fellow by the name of Mike Scully. Mike was also a legislative assistant, but he was primarily a speechwriter. He was brilliant and very conservative, very conservative. I mean, Mike was an early disciple of [William] Kristol. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh right. Of course, Bill Kristol. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Bill Kristol and George Will, and so I think that’s one of the things that was actually sort of refreshing. I was definitely on the other side of the spectrum from everybody. I would put Bob and Jeff in the middle, and I was definitely on the other side from my background and my activities, and we’d always have these really lively conversations at lunch. We frequently had very lively conversations when we got together with the Senator, too, because he had all views around him.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And he was interested in all those views and processing that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes. He definitely was. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He relied on his staff in that way. It wasn’t just to do the work to—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No, we weren’t told. We were rarely told. The only time we were told to do something the way he wanted it done was after a decision had been made, period. But we were there to present decisions, to present issues, and frequently there would be an open discussion. He had his senior staff, who were probably five or six people, and because I was the staff director of one of his subcommittees, I was considered part of that senior staff group. </p>
          <p>He had his administrative assistant at the time. He had Bob Dotchin. He had Jeff Baker, and he’d usually bring in Mike Scully for these discussions, because ultimately Mike might have to write a speech incorporating ideas, and we would frequently have an open discussion on Watergate legislation, for instance. I think Lowell at one time had in his separate views, I think he suggested that everyone should just disclose their tax returns. Of course the Senate legislation was not moving in that direction, and Bob said, “Well, you know, your previous view in your separate comments was tax returns should be disclosed. It’s not what this Committee is currently considering. How do you want to handle that?” “I’ll offer an amendment.” So we would move that way. It was a very open staff relationship. We didn’t have turf battles.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Which is remarkable, I think. I mean, I don’t know— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>We never had turf battles. I think he—he being the Senator—made clear from the very beginning that he was hiring this person to do this job, and he made that clear to everyone else who worked for him, to all of his senior staff. If you have an issue that might overlap, then you two get together, and then we’ll talk about it, and that’s usually the way it worked out. In the early days I had very few overlapping issues. The Governmental Affairs Committee work really didn’t overlap with the office at all. Frequently after I got into the routine of working with the office and working with legislation and also working with the full Committee, Dotchin would say, “I think it’s your call, it’s your judgment, and you should present it to the Senator. If you want me there as a backup, I’ll be there.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In terms of the functioning of these senior staff people, how atypical do you think this is in terms of the ability not to have turf battles? Would you say from what you observed of other offices at the time that this was unique, or do you think it was pretty typical in terms of the way senior staff worked with one another?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I don’t necessarily think it was that unique. I think if you had a fundamentally good administrator as your sponsor Senator—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>As the chief of staff, or the Senator? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>The Senator. Then quite frankly he’d laid it out as to how he wanted things handled. Where it could sometimes get difficult is if you had an administrative assistant on top of the legislative assistant who had to handle things. Frequently, that relationship might get a little confused and blurred as to who was making those decisions. There might be turf there if the administrative assistant felt that he or she had more responsibility over legislation. Then there was an added layer.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Now, did Senator Weicker have administrative assistants? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>He had administrative assistants. From time to time he had administrative assistants who for the most part were just that. They made the office run.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that’s a distinction between chief of staff—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>That is different from chief of staff. During the time that I was first with him, he did have an administrative assistant who came out of the Nixon administration, Pete Kinsey.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Could you say that name again?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Pete Kinsey.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Pete Kinsey. Thank you. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Pete came out of the White House counsel’s office, and so he knew a lot of background about Watergate. He was a friend of John Dean’s, but on the other hand, Pete might be able to fill in background. He never really attempted. He was brought in on discussions of Watergate legislation, but he was there mainly for background. Pete was a great guy. He really was. He didn’t try and interfere, but in other offices that does happen, and lines get blurred and you don’t know who’s making the decision. </p>
          <p>I remember that more from working at the full committee level later with Ribicoff, where we worked with probably 20 members of a committee and there were times when you didn’t know whether the decision was being made by the member’s committee staff, the legislative assistant, or the administrative assistant. There were just times when you just didn’t know who was the responsible authority there and you had a feeling that you weren’t quite getting through to the people you needed to get through to.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I can understand that. I mean just going through some of these timelines that have been prepared for this you see all the different details that enter into any of these processes and it just seems to me it’s amazing that any work really can get done and decisions made and people know who’s doing what.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, it’s interesting, because I think that when I went to the Governmental Affairs Committee, rather than having any difficulty with the personal staff and the relationship within the Senator’s office, his personal office, that all went rather smoothly, as I say, because he made the rules and he made the lines very clear and he followed them as well.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s a bigger challenge, isn’t it?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Why do you do have input? Why are you saying anything on this? He was smart enough to figure it out, too, if there were any questions. It was really within working on the Committee itself. Lowell was a junior Republican on the Committee. He had just been appointed to the Committee in 1975.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is the Committee on Governmental Affairs?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>On Governmental Affairs, and they wanted him because of his Watergate experience. He wanted to be there because of that, but he also wanted to be there because Governmental Affairs has jurisdiction over the entire government. There isn’t anything you can’t investigate on that Committee. We had a very strong group of members of the Committee. We had Ribicoff as chairman. The next senior member was probably [Henry M.] Scoop Jackson of Washington. John McClellan was on the Committee. Jackson was chairman of the Permanent Investigations Subcommittee, which was bigger than the full Committee in terms of staff. It harkened back to the old Un-American Activities Committee. It harkened back to the Alger Hiss investigations. Bobby Kennedy worked on that staff. The other members were John Glenn, Lawton Childs, Sam Nunn.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>A powerful committee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>On the Republican side, you had Charles Percy, who was the ranking member. You had Jacob Javits, who was the senior member. He had more years on the Committee than Percy, but had taken Foreign Relations as his ranking Committee. Bill Brock of Tennessee. Oh, gosh—Bill Roth of Delaware. Ted Stevens came later. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s amazing that you remember all this. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>At any rate, you had a number—the reason why I remember this is that you had a Committee—oh, Ed Muskie was on the Committee, too—where you had a lot of very senior Democrats and Republicans, well known with national reputations, and in walks Lowell Weicker because of his Watergate experience. I can remember after one of the very first hearings that I went to being taken aside by one Republican staff member, one member working for another Republican Senator. The staffer turned to me and he said, “Well, the first thing you have to realize is all the decisions on this Committee are made by Ribicoff, Javits, and Percy’s staff at a poker game,” a weekly poker game or a monthly poker game, I can’t remember, I think it may have been. And he said, “So forget having any impact.” A couple of months went by and I got an invitation to a poker game. [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You really established your worth.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>So, I felt, Okay. It seems that maybe they’re accepting Senator Weicker as part of that group, but no decisions were made at poker games. But there was a very powerful group of Senators whose staff did have a substantial amount of input on everything that came out of the full Committee. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So when you move from being a legislative assistant to the minority staff director, has your focus changed when you moved from—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>The focus basically is that you spend a little—the staff was small. I think we had three people, so there are some—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Spending more time—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And bringing along a junior member of the staff, reviewing more their legislative activities and doing some basic administrative work and spending more time on Subcommittee hearings working with—Lawton Childs was the chairman of the Subcommittee. I had to work with his staff director, who could’ve cared less about working with a woman. But at any rate, we did it. We got our Government in the Sunshine legislation, which was really Lawton Childs’s baby, passed by the Congress, and so they couldn’t have been happier. And by then, the Congress was probably over and Lowell Weicker decided he was going to try for a seat on the Appropriations Committee. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="005624"></a>0:56:24</p>
          <p class="c-header">First woman to be Appropriations clerk in Congress</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Before we get into that, I’d like to pick up on something you just said about being a woman in this important position, and of course then you’re going to become the Appropriations clerk, and I know you were the first woman in either House to hold that position. So did you find gender to be an important factor in those years in terms of your ability to work with people effectively?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Not really. I think that the exception—for me, I had to prove that I could do the job, and I always felt that if I did the job, it would not be a factor, and I think grudgingly this man who was the staff director would have to admit that I did the job that I was given.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You didn’t feel in terms of your ability to move into new positions that there was a glass ceiling?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, no. Far from it. In fact, there were not a lot of women on the Governmental Affairs Committee at all when I was first hired, either Subcommittee or full Committee. There were not a lot. There were some. Probably the highest-ranking person would have to be, I think, Scoop Jackson’s person. Scoop Jackson had a woman who worked for him for years on the Permanent Investigations Subcommittee, so I think that she had already broken the ceiling on the Committee, but I was hired at a time when there weren’t a lot of women in the Senate at all at professional staff levels. </p>
          <p>Ribicoff did have a professional woman on his senior staff at the full committee level, and so did Percy, and so that helped a lot. I think there are just bad eggs everywhere. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And this fellow just felt he could throw his power around and tell inappropriate jokes and act inappropriately and I felt that the more time I spent—I was lucky. I interacted with him on Subcommittee business, but I wasn’t the staff person. I assigned other staff people frequently to do the Subcommittee legislative issues and report back to me, and I handled the full Committee issues, which is why Senator Weicker was on the Committee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And so you do this for two years and you’re really at the center of all of these important initiatives about how the government’s going to run post-Watergate, and then in 1977, you moved to become part of the majority staff of Governmental Operations. Could you talk about that a little bit, why you make that move?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I did. Senator Weicker informed his senior staff shortly after he was re-elected in 1976 that he wanted to give up Governmental Affairs and go to Appropriations, and Appropriations is a big committee. I think it’s 27 or 29 people. I can’t remember. I think it’s more like 29. It’s almost a third of the Senate. He would be going in as the most junior member, which certainly guaranteed that he would be on the District of Columbia Subcommittee and some other nondescript subcommittee. </p>
          <p>On the other hand, he fully believed, and this was—I remember sitting down and talking with him and I said, “Why not the new Budget Committee? It’s going to set the budget priorities. Why don’t you want to go there?” And he said, “They can set all the priorities they want, but they can’t dish out the money.” It’s just as simple as that. It is the ability to fund those programs which are in the budget and the budget sets the priorities of the country. The Budget Committee can do everything it wants to do, but he wanted to be on the committee that made the last decision and the most consequential decision, where the money was actually going. He could represent Connecticut better, he felt, because of Connecticut’s defense industry, his interests in underwater research.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Just seeing NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] on the news last night. There was a big—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Was there really? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—about the oil spill down in Louisiana and the efforts to control it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Right, right. But he fundamentally believed that you can do anything you want in Congress, but that the Appropriations Committee was where the power was and that’s where he wanted to be. At that time, under the new rules in the Senate, for each committee a Senator was appointed to he would get two additional—if you weren’t a chairman, you would get two additional personal staff members. They were called S. Res. 60 people. It’s the resolution that they were approved under. Those staff members would be supposedly assigned to your personal staff working with the committee staff of whatever committee, so he offered me a job as one of his S. Res. 60 people on Appropriations.</p>
          <p>I should also say I think one of the reasons why he decided to leave Governmental Affairs, too, is that fundamentally I don’t think Lowell really believed that the Watergate reform legislation was going to solve the problems that rose during Watergate, and I think history has proven that that’s— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>True. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Correct. I think probably the most valuable piece of the Watergate reform legislation as we look at it today was the establishment of a congressional counsel, the Office of Congressional Counsel, to represent Congress so that Congress doesn’t have to go out and hire its own lawyers. But at any rate, there were indications that he was dissatisfied as it was moving forward earlier, so I thought about the S. Res. 60 position and I finally came to the conclusion that, no, I really wanted to stay and work directly on a committee.</p>
          <p>Ribicoff’s people, nicely enough, had actually talked to me about what I was going to do. They were picking up additional jurisdiction. They were going to have— Jimmy Carter had just been elected, and Jimmy Carter’s whole legislative program was reorganization of the government, and all that legislation had to go through that committee. They knew that they were going to have a huge work buildup and they needed additional staff, plus they’d been given jurisdiction over the Post Office and Civil Service. They talked to me to ask me whether I was interested. I didn’t have anything in hand, but I thought about it and I turned down the S. Res. 60 job. To me, that was like being in limbo where you’re neither fish nor fowl. You’re really a member of the personal staff, but you work on committee issues, and yet you have no authority within the committee at all. I didn’t want to be in that sort of purgatory.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It was the level of responsibility and the issues that you would be working on.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes. I must say it was. It was both. I knew it would be exciting working on a committee that was going to be really busy under a new presidency. I also probably at that time had an immature view of the work of the Appropriations Committee. I didn’t think that sitting down working with tables of numbers really was something that I wanted to do. I felt I wanted to be more on the policy side of things. Little did I know that one law is as good as another, as someone told me. [laughter] So later on, there’s a lot of legislating and policy in appropriation bills, too.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Except that Senator Weicker was going to be a junior member, and as you said, you would’ve had this position.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>It was neither fish nor fowl. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you wouldn’t have really had very much impact on the appropriations process or—yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Right, exactly, and honestly—he was assigned, I think, to the Treasury Subcommittee on Appropriations, and I guess State, Justice, Commerce—I don’t remember. He may have been assigned to Defense, but he already had someone on his personal staff who did solely Defense work.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And now when you say “he” you’re talking about—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Weicker. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And so it was unlikely I would become directly involved in any defense issues. I met the staff directors of the subcommittees and the minority staff directors, more importantly, of the subcommittees he was assigned to, and quite frankly, they weren’t impressed and neither was I.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Impressed by?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>By my credentials for working with them. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And I thought that they were rather condescending or patronizing, patronizing would be the more appropriate term, both toward the junior member coming on as well as his supposed staff, and I think I just decided that these were battles that were better left to other people.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That was probably very wise. How long then do you spend working with Ribicoff?  </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I spent— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>A full four years?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I spent four years, from ’77 to ’81, when he retired, and during those four years I probably had the best education I had anywhere.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I was just going to ask you what you learned in those years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I learned a tremendous amount. First of all, I was working directly with well-qualified attorneys on his staff. His staff director and three or four other senior committee staff who did legislation were really very well qualified, very capable draftsmen. We had the most stimulating discussions morning, noon, and night about legislative impact, legislative language, how to appropriately put together, write legislation, working with the office of the legal counsel, working with the White House staff, working with agency staff to draft legislation. I really learned most of my legislative skills from them and was included in all of that. I was drafting legislation. I would send it up to have someone, one of the lawyers on our staff, look it over. We always worked in teams, and I was not the only non-lawyer on the staff. There were a few of us and we were never treated any differently, and so everything was a team effort, whether it was the financial disclosure legislation that we wrote that I worked on or even the legal counsel legislation I had parts of. </p>
          <p>The Civil Service Reform Act was really my biggest responsibility. It was the first reform of the Civil Service System since it had been established, and that was a priority of the Carter administration. That was my main responsibility during those years.</p>
          <p>I truly enjoyed working on that staff and working closely with—I mean, this was the other thing, too—because Ribicoff worked very closely with Javits and Percy, which was true. But it was the Senators’ decision to work together. This wasn’t made at the poker game [laughter], and they both had really well qualified staff as well. Javits had brilliant staff and I just felt that I was working amongst real stars.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What’s your relationship during those years with people in Weicker’s office?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I still saw them. I still saw Bob Dotchin. We would have lunch together.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>There wasn’t any substantial overlap in your work you were doing with Ribicoff. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No, there wasn’t, but obviously there were legislative issues, too, when the Watergate reform legislation was coming through Committee. Jeff Baker, I think, was handling it at the time. Maybe Bob Dotchin, parts of it, and we would have lunch and discuss why this and that. We were looking for sponsors and support, too, so Weicker was particularly important to have on board, because the Republicans were leery about some of the parts of the legislation. So yes, I was still working with other staff, not just the Committee. There were a lot of things going on in that committee, and I did the sunset legislation, which Ribicoff, Javits, and Percy privately opposed. </p>
          <p>This was Ed [Edmund] Muskie’s big bill to sunset all government agencies and departments. Ribicoff, Javits, and Percy worried about the changing, more conservative attitude in the Congress, which had begun probably about the time Lowell was elected, maybe two years later, 1972, when Lawton Childs and Sam Nunn and maybe Bennett Johnston—when there were conservative southerners elected and they were very concerned that longstanding civil rights programs, primarily civil rights programs and social programs, would be sunsetted when you had the advent—by that time I think Jesse Helms—was he elected? </p>
          <p> There were certainly more conservative Republicans in the Senate at that time, and it was more difficult to pass some progressive legislation. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>So people were getting tired of reform and they were also getting—I mean, there was Watergate fatigue.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You’re talking late ’70s?</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Late ’70s, exactly, as the Congress turned to other issues.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The Congress was beginning to shift, right. The later Carter years.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Right, exactly, and a President that wasn’t particularly strong at that time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>So there was some concern that great social initiatives would not garner the support that they needed to be reauthorized. They required a positive reauthorization, and we held the hearings and I’m trying to think—we actually did get—I’ll tell you who came and testified against the sunset bill, Dale Bumpers. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>God bless him, because nobody dared speak out against Muskie’s legislation, and Dale Bumpers did, and people suddenly began to sit back and say maybe we should move slower on this, so we did. We did. We held the hearings, but never quite—and then Muskie was appointed Secretary of State by Carter and the legislation died a normal death.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That was useful, then.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>It was. But there was, really—I didn’t have any—my job was to put together the hearings and to advise Senator Ribicoff. He was very leery and I remember sitting at a meeting with Ribicoff, Javits, and Percy where they openly discussed their concerns about that. </p>
          <p>[Brief discussion of when to take a break]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Now this just occurred to me, and this may be completely off the wall, but I’m going to pose this question anyway. So far, the two major people you’re working for are both from Connecticut. You’re obviously bringing real skills to this job, but do you think the Connecticut connection had anything to do with initially being hired by Senator Weicker and then the connection to Ribicoff?</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I know that it had to do with being hired by Senator Weicker. I know it. He definitely liked to have Connecticut people on his staff. They weren’t exclusively from Connecticut, but he did like to have Connecticut people on his staff, so it was a real plus. As I said, he never asked me about political leanings, but I think he knew, and as far as Ribicoff is concerned, that was not an issue. I don’t even know that Ribicoff ever knew I was from Connecticut until I was already working for him.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He knew your work and he’d seen you in these other capacities.</p>
<p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>He’d seen me and I was recommended by Dick Wegman, who was his staff director of governmental affairs. Dick was not from Connecticut either. He had worked for [William] Proxmire before he worked for Ribicoff and he was just very able, and Ribicoff [laughter]—Ribicoff certainly never asked me what political party or persuasion I was from and in fact, I remember sitting on the Senate floor. The most senior woman on our full Committee staff was a woman by the name of Marilyn Harris, who handled the Department of Education legislation. Ribicoff had been Secretary of Health, Education &amp; Labor under Kennedy and was the chief sponsor of a bill to create the Department of Education, and we’re sitting on the Senate floor. He’s managing something—I can’t remember honestly what piece of legislation it was.</p>
          <p> I was sitting next to him and Marilyn was also sitting there with us, and Jim Abourezk, Senator Abourezk, from South Dakota—he was Lebanese and he was the only Arab American I think at the time, maybe there was one other, but anyway, he came up to Ribicoff on the floor. He liked to needle people and he said, “How’s my cousin doing?” Ribicoff looked at him and said, “Your cousin?” He said, “Yes, Marilyn.” Ribicoff looked at Marilyn and he said, “Excuse me. I don’t know.” He said, “You know she’s Lebanese, don’t you, Abe?” And Ribicoff turned to him and said, very seriously, “I never inquire into the personal beliefs or background or my staff.” [laughter] </p>
<p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Good for him. He laid it out there. </p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>He really did. He really did. But at any rate—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, anyway, so then you worked for him until he retired and you learn all these different skills in working with all these different people on significant issues, and then in 1981 you become the Appropriations clerk, which really means the staff director, as I understand it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>That’s right. That’s the old term for it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And it’s the Appropriations clerk for what?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, okay. For the Subcommittee on State, Justice, Commerce &amp; Independent Agencies. Just as the name suggests, the Departments of State, Department of Justice, Commerce, also the Judiciary, and a whole raft of independent agencies, including the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission], the FCC [Federal Communications Commission], the Consumer Protection Agency, the part of Public Television and EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission], just most of the independent agencies of the federal government, which—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It was a huge job.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, it was big. I’m trying to think that maybe the budget was nowhere near what I later did. The budget may have been $10 billion at that time, maybe $12 billion, obviously much bigger now, but huge in that you have to know, you have to go through, all of the justifications for all the programs in all those agencies and departments. There are just enormous volumes of paperwork involved in learning about them. </p>
          <p>I don’t think there’s as much justification for the Defense Department as there is for State, Justice, Commerce, just simply by virtue of the amount of material that’s involved in each agency justification going down to very minor programs. I know there wasn’t as much as justification at HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] in terms of paperwork. I mean, if I wasn’t in hearings all day, I certainly was reading every single justification. It actually was like studying for a final exam. You had to read all these mounds of material to get to know the agencies and then go back over it again to prepare for the hearings.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And how often would there be hearings? Were they continuous hearings?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Continuous hearings from the time—the budget would be presented sometime in January and then the hearings would begin maybe mid-February.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So who hired you for that position?</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="012452"></a>1:24:52</p>
          <p class="c-header">Becomes Lowell Weicker’s staff director for Appropriations Committee</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>That’s an interesting process. What happened in 1980, as you recall, is the Republicans gained the majority in the Senate. On Governmental Affairs, it had been assumed that Tom Eagleton was going to be the next chairman, and I had already been approached about staying in my job. </p>
          <p>Then all of a sudden, election night came along and there’s a big change. I was out of work in an instant, or at least within hours. I ran into Jeff Baker and Jeff said, “What are you going to do?” and I said, “I haven’t the foggiest idea.” Jeff said to me, “How do you feel about going back to Appropriations?” And I said, “It depends.” He said, “Well, let me talk to the boss and see, because obviously he needs to hire people now.” And he needed to hire people for Bob Dotchin. He also became chairman of the Small Business Committee, which was also under the jurisdiction of State, Justice, Commerce, and he needed— </p>
          <p>Bob Dotchin moved to become staff director of Small Business, so he moved from the personal staff. Jeff became really the LA [legislative aide], and the next thing I knew a few days later I got a telephone call from Senator Weicker asking me if I’d like to come and talk to him. And I did. And he said, “As you know, I’m going to be chairman it looks like of State, Justice, Commerce. How would you like to go directly to the Appropriations Committee this time? How would you like to be my staff director?” I said, “Yes, I think I’d like that.” It’s a lot better than—there wasn’t much room for unemployed Democrats in the Senate those days, so he said, “Obviously, this decision is Senator Hatfield’s decision. I can only recommend, and you’re going to have to meet with his people.”</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Can you explain to me why it’s Hatfield’s decision?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Technically, the chairman of the full committee hires everyone. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I see. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>If he doesn’t want to hire you, he’s not going to hire you. The chairman of the full committee is responsible for all of the staff on the committee. In that committee, all the hiring was done directly by the chairman and the ranking member.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So Hatfield is chairman?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Hatfield became chairman of Appropriations, and so I think a few days went by again. I received a telephone call from Keith Kennedy, who was going to be Hatfield’s staff director, and I went over and I met with Keith. We talked at length and he said, “Well, you have no background on the Appropriations Committee. Do you realize that our clerks—” Keith was the chief clerk—“come from either the budget agencies or they’ve come up through the ladders, the chairs here, on the Committee? They either come from an agency budget office or they come up through the chairs here on the Committee. It’s very unusual to hire from outside the process. So what’s your background?” </p>
          <p>We talked a little bit about my background and I said, “One of things—” this was lucky, because when I was on the full Committee staff under Ribicoff I did work on oversight over the Budget Act and the budget process. That probably saved me more than anything else, and he said, “We’ll talk to the Chairman.” I think I met briefly with Senator Hatfield and then finally got a call from Weicker that the appointment had been approved.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you’re recommended by Weicker, but you’re hired by Hatfield.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Hired by Hatfield, and in fact, to the extent that my pay level was set by Hatfield, which actually was pretty good for me at the time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are you a single parent at this time?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No, no. I had one child. My second child was born while I worked on the Appropriations Committee. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh my. My goodness.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>[laughter] I remember being very pregnant and spending all night in the Senate. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So then basically the chain of command, in a sense, is that you’re working at this point for Hatfield? Is that right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, I suppose the chain of command was I worked directly under Weicker, and eventually everything goes through the full Committee. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I see. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>So you report to your subcommittee chairman and work under his direction, but the ultimate responsibility for hiring and firing you is Senator Hatfield and that’s the way they kept it. That’s I’m sure the way they’ve kept it ever since the Appropriations Committee process was established in the Congress a hundred and something years before, and they used the old title, “clerk,” because that’s just what they probably were in the very beginning, wearing little eyeshades and working with charts and numbers.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And again, I’m sorry. You’re just going to have to explain this, because I’m not quite getting it, and so I think maybe others won’t get it either, but your position here is one of several staff people on the Appropriations Committee. You’re working for the—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Subcommittee—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Which is State— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>State, Justice, Commerce at this time.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So the Appropriations clerk for that Subcommittee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>For that Subcommittee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Which then reports up to the full Appropriations Committee.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And obviously the way the legislation goes, by tradition, the House first passes an Appropriation bill in the process, but the bill—when the budget is presented, it’s divided up by subcommittee in the Appropriations Committee so you get your agency budget and justifications and all the background material you need, and we work from the President’s budget request for the coming fiscal year.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What do you remember as your biggest challenges in this position? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, it’s State, Justice, Commerce. They were big. They were big, and this is something I’ve thought about in many respects. This is really, I think, what began to mark Lowell’s career as well. Ronald Reagan, when he was elected, came in and he had, I think, four basic policies. You can go off in a lot of other directions, but a powerful defense and foreign policy and a very nationalistic foreign policy. He preached self-reliance. He was an advocate of less government being the best government, less federal government being the best government, and also putting more back to the states, both in terms of putting more decision making back in the states and consequently eliminating federal programs, block-granting them, and giving the authority to the states to run them. That’s all well and good.</p>
          <p>The way the budget worked, you have two basic parts of the budget. You have the discretionary budget and you have the non-discretionary budget. The non-discretionary budget is interest on the national debt and the entitlement programs, and the discretionary budget was divided into defense and domestic discretionary programs. </p>
          <p>If you look at what he was proposing, he was proposing obviously to beef up the defense part of the discretionary budget at the cost of domestic programs, and unfortunately, a lot of what he was proposing fell really hard on those who were young, elderly, disabled, and poor. It’s one thing to preach self-reliance, but it wasn’t very good during the Reagan years if you were disabled or for some other reason you were unable to take advantage of the opportunities that America presented. We saw some of this in this bill, in this State, Justice, Commerce bill. </p>
          <p>We saw significant cuts in civil rights enforcement in the Justice Department. We saw the proposed elimination of the Legal Services Administration. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I remember that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>We saw the elimination of the Small Business Administration, which actually is pretty contrary to most Republican belief today and throughout the budget. The State Department had a very small budget of educational programs which included all of the Fulbright programs, the Fulbright scholarships, and there were a couple of other scholarship programs, international graduate programs, one run by Georgetown University, and there was another that was called the Senior Executive Service, which basically retrained business executives to go out into the Third World and to advise people as to how to use their talents to teach people. </p>
          <p>And then we also saw a major change in the way the administration proposed to handle our contributions to the United Nations by basically only paying three of our four quarters and allowing our obligations to drift into the next fiscal year. Well, it’s a gimmick, but it’s a gimmick that they would propose year after year after year. Consequently, the United States would eventually wind up a whole year in arrears, impacting obviously what the United Nations could do, but it worked with his basic highly nationalist rhetoric. And we would get Alexander Haig, Secretary of State, to come in and to justify the UN payment scheme and the elimination of all these education programs which the United States shouldn’t be funding and we’d have the Attorney General come up and talk about why we needed to beef up major crimes and why it was justified to reduce our enforcement of civil rights laws. </p>
          <p>The same thing with Jeane Kirkpatrick. She would come in on the UN budget, and of course she was justifying our delaying payments, and there was some real concern about the Legal Service Administration. There were a lot of conservatives who didn’t like the Legal Services Administration, the President included, because poor people living in subsidized housing, their Legal Services attorneys would cite the United States as parties in lawsuits. [laughter] Heavens! We’re suing ourselves because somebody’s living in Section 8 housing where the water is leaking and there’s mold on the walls, but they were activists. They were too activist, so there was this whole philosophy that carried through right from day one when you looked at Reagan’s budget, whether it was State, Justice, Commerce, and obviously eventually later with the HHS budgets where there was huge impact. </p>
          <p>The Legal Services Administration I think is the greatest triumph. We saved it. We absolutely saved it. The House did not put it in its budget. The House basically would send over the President’s budget for the most part, no Legal Services, no Fulbright programs, and add language that would prevent the courts from taking cases or from using busing as a remedy. The court-stripping legislation was also in our appropriation bill. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>They would write legislative language which would deny the use of funds to enforce any court-ordered school busing to the Justice Department and try to deny the courts the ability to hear cases which might involve the transportation of children across school districts, so we began to see it right from the start on State, Justice, Commerce.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And how does one in the position that you were in working with people you were working with, how do you actually overcome that philosophy? You just kind of put the appropriations back into the bills, but you’re also having to convince other members of the Senate at the same time? How did you overcome some of the challenges that you’ve just—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Legal Services was probably the greatest. Legal Services and the busing legislation were the greatest. And I’m at a loss because I don’t have the Committee reports, but the Legal Services, we actually devised legislation. We put the money back in the bill and we devised legislation which satisfied people about their—we worked out some sort of a compromise, and I’d have to go back and look. I think it’s still in law today. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m sure we have all those records.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, I hope you do. Actually, if you do, I’d love to look at the report language because that’s where—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, they must be in the papers, and in any case, wouldn’t the reports have to be public record?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>The reports would have to be public record.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So they’d be in government documents, and maybe not in the Lowell Weicker papers. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I need to obtain them, actually. I would like to. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Tell me exactly what you want me to do so I can find them.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I’d like to get the debate on the FY ’82 budget for State, Justice, Commerce and I’d like to get the Committee report on that bill. That one I think is the most important, and I’ll think of the others. But that would begin to fill in some holes as to what was attempted on this bill because Jesse Helms and others were very actively involved. We had great difficulty passing our bill. I think we finally got it passed, but we had to go to a continuing resolution. </p>
          <p>We made cuts. There were also other proposed areas. Reagan’s penchant for deregulation extended to the enforcement arms of the SEC, the FCC, the Consumer Products Safety Commission. They wanted to basically reduce substantially the enforcement arms of the independent agencies. In our bill we had the facilities funding for public television. They wanted to eliminate all of that. In 90 percent of the cases, we were successful in restoring, if not all, some of the funds, and we would just make cuts elsewhere. </p>
          <p>NOAA. The NOAA bill, and that year, as I recall, in a supplemental appropriation or a rescission, a reconciliation bill, the administration asked for the elimination of funds for the NOAA fleet. I’m sure Lowell has talked about this.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, we haven’t gotten into the NOAA stuff quite yet.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>But I think it came up in terms of a reconciliation bill or a supplemental appropriation where they were shifting funds around within NOAA and they wanted to eliminate the ships. Well, it’s awfully difficult to have an oceans research agency without having anything that floats on water, and Lowell as chairman, and having spent part of his career trying to build up NOAA’s research capacity, which is puny in comparison to what we spend in the space programs, was furious. </p>
          <p>The Secretary of Commerce at the time, Malcolm Baldrige, was from Connecticut, and Lowell called Mac Baldrige personally. He knew him well. He called him and he said, “Mac, how can you have an oceans research agency without any research ships? Explain that to me.” And he basically said, “Well, Lowell, you know, it’s an OMB [Office of Management and Budget] proposal to cut funds from the budget, and we’re going along with it.” He said, “That’s just absurd.” He said, “No, Lowell, it’s not. It’s a position of the Department.” </p>
          <p>I think we had a hearing on it or in the course of our hearings on the supplemental we discussed it, and at any rate, Lowell called me into his office. I was very new to the Appropriations Committee at the time and said to me, “I want something done to get Malcolm Baldrige’s attention that you cannot possibly have a research agency without any ships,” and I said, “Okay, what do you want me to do?” I’ll never forget his response. He said, “You’re Italian. You should be good at this.” I said, “I’m not going there.” [laughter] </p>
          <p>So I went back and Tim Keeney actually said, “Just remember, revenge is best served cold.” Tim Keeney actually handled the Department of Commerce budget and NOAA and knew it far better than I, and I sat down with Tim and I told him what the Senator said, and I said, “Tim, what do you recommend?” He said, “Oh, give me a day or so and I’ll come back with something.” Tim came back with legislation for the supplemental, which effectively denied the Secretary the funding for his office. It removed all of his staff. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Whoa. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>So that he basically had an office and a desk and a telephone and that was it and we just did it by transferring funds and restoring the funds for NOAA and it was passed by the Senate. </p>
          <p>There was a colloquium on the floor during the course of that debate which explained—  there was no other real explanation in the report, but it was in the legislative history that the cut was intended to remove all secretarial and support staff from the Office of the Secretary.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The Office of the Secretary of—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>From the Office of the Secretary. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Of Commerce. And so I think within days—the House went along with it so it was passed in the supplemental and they didn’t pick it up. The Commerce Department did not pick it up—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Didn’t they have to know what they were passing? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They did?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, yes, they did. They did. The House Chairman’s attitude was, he said, “Listen, this is your fight. You’re a Republican. I’m not going to—who am I to tell you not to do this?” His name was Neal Smith and I think he was from Iowa.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So, within days—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Within days of the conference report passing, the Commerce Department suddenly realized what had happened and the Secretary of Commerce was ballistic. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I can imagine. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And Lowell said, “Well, now you’ll see how the Office of the Secretary can operate without any staff just like NOAA would’ve had to operate without any ships.”  [laughter] Anyway, a compromise. The issue was settled, again, within a matter of days. I think OMB sent up some sort of report to redirect funds so that the funding for the Office of the Secretary could be put back in place, but the point was made.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Were there other situations like that where you also had to use—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Punitive tactics like that. Not really. It was the most punitive thing I think that was ever done, but it was done strictly to get his attention, and his attention was gotten on the matter and future budgets had funding for NOAA ships. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Now I still want to talk about when you become Appropriations clerk for the Subcommittee on Health &amp; Human Services. I want to talk some about which issues were most important to you in all of your career. I’m wondering if you’d like to do that today or if you’d like to—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I have time if you do.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I do. I’ve had you talking for a long time.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I don’t mind. I would just as soon get through this phase. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. I’m fine. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Let me just sum up State, Justice, though. I think that when Lowell became Chairman of the State, Justice, Commerce Subcommittee, there were some within some of those departments who, and I think particularly the Justice Department, who were very skeptical of what they were dealing with in terms of—they obviously saw Lowell Weicker as a maverick. They saw him as someone who was far more liberal than the previous chairman, who had been Fritz Hollings, and they didn’t know what to expect. They were very wary. </p>
          <p>The FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] budget people were very nervous because Lowell had been so critical during Watergate over the activities the FBI found itself engaged in, and the Justice Department as well. When it all washed out, I think they found that they had a pretty impartial chairman who was able to separate the policy that he disagreed with from the actual responsibilities of those departments, the real responsibilities of those departments. </p>
          <p>Yes, funding was restored for the civil rights division and others within, and the Justice Department probably breathed a great big sigh of relief, but Lowell didn’t take a hacksaw to the FBI or to any of its important programs. In fact, he was very concerned that they had the right type of personnel for the jobs that they had to do. </p>
          <p>Ironically, when I left I think there was some regret that he was leaving as chairman in the end because they didn’t necessarily get to know him, but they got to know him through his action on the budget and through interface with me as his staff director, and I think they were very grateful for the way they were handled. In fairness, there were real differences, real policy differences with the political appointees, the political appointees being William French Smith, who was the Attorney General at the time, with Alexander Haig, with Jeane Kirkpatrick, Malcolm Baldrige, on the ships, yes, but on other things. I don’t think necessarily that Lowell came down terribly hard on Commerce. </p>
          <p>It’s hard to get really wound up about the Bureau of Standards and Statistics and Patent Office when you look at what the day-to-day responsibilities of these agencies are. They’re pretty apolitical. It was the difference in policy that he went after the appointees on. He was very fair as far as the Judiciary was concerned and very fair to be sure that—  I mean, his concern was that there be no political interference with the Judiciary. He was very sympathetic to their pleas for more staff and certainly for more judges because of the backlogs that they had in the lower courts. I just wanted to make it clear that—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What kind of direct pressure would you get from those political appointees? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Once the hearings were over, I dealt with whoever their congressional liaison people were and they would come and say, “Well, this is administration policy,” and I would say, “Yes, but you know we’re likely to disagree.” “Then we’ll have to seek support elsewhere on the Committee.” I understood that, but I also knew that again there would be amendments offered within the Committee as we brought the bill from Subcommittee first. </p>
          <p>Lowell made a real effort to help. In today’s jargon, with pork barrel projects, I mean, let’s face it. It’s the way the system has worked in the past, nothing like what you see today. But yes, there were the fish farms in Arkansas or the aquaculture farming in Hawaii. I don’t know, but for the most part, the Committee was pretty sympathetic to what was going on. </p>
          <p>There were Republicans—Warren Rudman, who’s a former prosecutor and former, I think, Attorney General, who was very upset about the Legal Services, and so that Lowell could remove himself as perhaps a flashpoint, he asked Warren Rudman to take the lead on Legal Services, which was great. It was a brilliant move on his part because this wasn’t just a Lowell Weicker proposal. Lowell moved into the role of supportive rather than point man, and so his relationship with the members of the Subcommittee was great, and that is what enabled him to bring a bill to the full Committee every year, and yes, we might have to have another amendment to knock out Legal Services at the full Committee, but we knew we had the votes. Some people didn’t like it, but it was always really when we got to the floor that we worried about the Helms amendments.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, of course, and that’s even later on after you leave that seems to be an even bigger issue.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes, he was a constant thorn. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. It sounds like it. So you do this for two years. In 1983 you move to be Appropriations Clerk of the Subcommittee—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>—on Labor, Health and Human Services. Yes. Let me just also say, because I think this is really important, the administration always had its targets, its bottom line. The first year on the Appropriations Committee the Senate was not able to pass all of the Appropriations bills because of controversy, and therefore we had to go to a massive continuing resolution for I don’t know, five or six of the appropriation bills, and it may have been even closer to the entire government that first year. That means that agencies under a normal continuing resolution are funded at the lower of last year’s appropriation or the House passed appropriation, or if there’s a Senate bill, the lower of any of those three. That meant that that’s effectively a cut for everybody in real terms. </p>
          <p>So in the final continuing resolution, which was passed, I think, in either late November or early December—it was very close to the holidays—we incorporated our entire Senate-passed bill. The House had a passed bill. We incorporated the language of our entire Committee-passed bill into the continuing resolution and therefore conferenced a full bill with the House. That was unusual. It allowed us to get everybody at real levels. We had to sit down with David Stockman several times at the Committee level and he would frequently call—he would go through all of the bills and say who is over the administration’s budget and who was under the administration’s budget. Somehow he forgot the fact that Congress has a say in these matters as well. It wasn’t the President’s budget. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It was the United States budget. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>It’s no longer the Bible. Yes. And somehow he managed to forget that the President’s budget was no longer the Bible. But anyway, he was representing a different party now, and he called us out as being over the budget and we went back and we worked on it and brought some numbers down and went back to conference with him. </p>
          <p>Again, all the other committees are there, and he looked at me and he said, “Well, congratulations, State, Justice, Commerce, you are now within the outlay number. But you have all these programs that the administration has proposed eliminating,” and I said, “That’s right. This is Congress’s prerogative at this point.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And I said, “It depends on whether you’re here to talk about Legal Services or are you here to talk about outlays?” and he said, “I’m here to talk about outlays.” And so from OMB’s standpoint, we finally appreciated the fact that it was the bottom line OMB cared about and not the policy, and as long as we met the numbers, we were okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s fascinating. So what would you say in those years was your biggest triumph? Was it saving the Legal Services?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I think saving Legal Services. I think saving the NOAA fleet, certainly saving the oceans research programs. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Even though the numbers are not staggering. Making the point that not only were there some liberal members of Congress who were willing to stand up to the administration, but also that there were moderates who were willing to stand up for these programs as well, that there was disagreement over the individual items in the budget, but we weren’t being imprudent. It extended beyond the individual items to the fact that Congress was just not going to bow and the Republican Senate was not just going to bow to this President.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you’re doing this work in the early years of the Reagan administration, so you’re really just discovering what the larger scale goals are, because you start this in 1981 when you’re doing it, so— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Right. And actually, truthfully, in 1981, when we started with that first supplemental bill, we were starting with the last of the Carter budget. ’81 was still a Carter budget, so Reagan submitted the supplemental, which added lots of money for defense and then proposed all of these other cuts on the domestic side.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And in ’83?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>In ’83. Ed Brooke had been chairman of Labor, Health &amp; Human Services. I believe that’s right. No, was he defeated in ’82? I think so. There was a vacancy in the chairmanship and Senator Hatfield was the next ranking member, and then Lowell. Senator Hatfield called Senator Weicker in to talk to him and said, “Lowell, will you take Labor, Health &amp; Human Services? Because if you don’t, I’ll have to.” </p>
          <p>I think Hatfield was Chairman of the Energy Subcommittee, and he didn’t want to give it up, but I believe that the next person in line behind Lowell, and I can’t remember who it was, was very conservative Senator [Harrison] Schmitt, I think a former astronaut. At any rate, Senator Hatfield wanted a more moderate Republican to chair the Subcommittee, and Lowell was thrilled. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I can imagine.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>It worked out very well because he could combine his interests on the Authorizing Committee with funding on the Appropriations Subcommittee. He was thrilled. He was absolutely thrilled to be chairman.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And the Authorizing Committee would be what?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, the names are practically the same. I think it was Labor, Health &amp; Human Resources.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. So he’s on both committees simultaneously.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>He’s on both committees, and it included the Labor, Health &amp; Human Resources, included Education as well. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>—as did the Subcommittee, so all of the Social Services plus Education and Labor—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s a real powerhouse position.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>We’re in that Appropriations Committee, and he could fund his disabilities programs through that Committee, so I moved over with him. There was no question about the fact that I would move over with him to become the clerk. It’s a much bigger staff. I think we had ten people in all, including myself, on the staff. At that time, it was a $300 billion bill. It’s much more than that today, moving from a $10 billion dollar bill. The $300 billion included Medicare and Medicaid and the Social Security trust funds, which are all off budget but still require administrative expenses for the agencies. </p>
          <p>So I think the basic bill was probably about $35 billion, and there you really did come up against the social philosophy of the Reagan administration. There you came up against his interests in reducing the size of the federal budget, reducing the size of the federal government by eliminating programs at the federal level and just giving block grants to the states, combining, for instance, higher education funding into a higher education block grant which would include Pell Grants and other student aid, etc.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And allow states to administer it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And allow states to administer it. Same thing with community service programs and community health care centers. They would all be under a community service block grant, and quite frankly, the majority of the Senate, even though it was a slimmer majority at that time after the election of more conservative Republicans, still the moderate Republicans I think were reduced to five or six, maybe a couple of others, at different times on different bills, but you had a Democratic minority which combined with a handful of Republicans to be the majority, essentially. It’s the same thing. </p>
          <p>If you want to put it a different way, a handful of Republicans controlled the majority in the Senate because the Democrats couldn’t move without them and they couldn’t move without the Democrats. I mean, it was Lowell Weicker, it was Mark Hatfield, it was Bob Stafford of Vermont, it was Mark Andrews of South Dakota, and John Chafee. You may have had, on different issues, Mac Matthias and Bob Packwood, but that was about it. The great moderate Republican era was over in terms of numbers, and Stafford and Weicker were able to work together rather effectively on the Authorizing Committee, Stafford doing the education legislation and Weicker doing the disabilities legislation then, and transferring that, their product, to Appropriations later and funding for programs. </p>
          <p>Obviously the big sticking point was that the administration never got their block grant proposals. They were not authorized. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And therefore we funded everything as it had been funded. All the agencies were maintained as they were and funding was increased for programs like community health centers, like Title I aid for education, which is for the economically disadvantaged, special ed programs, those funds were increased. Pell Grants were increased. Education grants were increased. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was not eliminated.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>As it may be again. [laughter] </p>

          <p class="c-header">Budgetary challenges for the Department of Education</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>As it may be again. The Department of Education, in every budget, the administration requested that it be eliminated.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Eliminate the Department?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>The entire Department of Education.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really? I don’t remember that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I think the administration’s view was that education was fundamentally a state matter. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And to separate education? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>The remnants of education would go back into HHS and it would become, again, the Department of Health, Education &amp; Welfare, but, no, Education was a big thorn in their side. William Bennett was Secretary. First, Maggie Heckler.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And Terrel [Bell]? Wasn’t there a—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, yes, but that’s later. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Is that later? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes, Terrel—Oh. Well, maybe you’re— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I don’t think so. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No, maybe not. During those Reagan years, but later —</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think he comes first, and then—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, in the years that I was on the Subcommittee, Margaret Heckler—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In ’82, I know Terrel Bell— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes. Well, he is gone. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>William Bennett in ’85. So. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, ’85. He was there earlier than ’85.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, I know he is, but that’s when some of these issues —</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>But Margaret Heckler was there in ’83. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Former congresswoman from Massachusetts.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And they’re all happy to see the whole Department eliminated?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, she didn’t last very long, she really didn’t. Quite frankly, I don’t know why she didn’t last very long. I have a feeling that having been more moderate she may have been uncomfortable in the environment, but I have no clue why she was not there longer. </p>
          <p>My greatest memories are of Secretary Bennett coming to justify eliminating the Department of Education based on the fact that we needed a strong national defense. It was as though the Secretary of Defense was sitting and talking to the Committee. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Early AIDS education and funding for research</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And then, of course, in the course of these discussions we would get into the issues like teaching abstinence, and inevitably the issue of AIDS education would come up, and, no, they did not believe it was appropriate to have AIDS education in the schools. Chairman Senator Weicker’s view was that if you’re facing a war, you give people bullets and you educate them as to what they’re facing out there, and no, the administration did not believe in that. Others—</p>
          <p>I’m wrong. Terrel Bell was, and then William Bennett. Margaret Heckler was at HHS. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. That makes sense. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>She was at HHS. That’s my mistake. And of course she had to speak to this policy of—there were proposals for clean needles once it began to be established just how one got infected by AIDS. Condoms, etc. The whole philosophy of the administration was that this was a gay disease when we learned about it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Or of drug addicts, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes, but mainly a gay disease, and that only teaches people about inappropriate sexual behavior, and it would be wrong for the federal government to promote—it would be promoting inappropriate sexual behavior if we told people to use condoms, and it’s the same thing. It’s just what you would’ve expected if you were in a small, rural town in I suppose the early ’60s talking about sex education, but this from people who were supposedly intelligent and who know what the facts are as to how people became infected. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>The only question I have here about this timeline [referring to a document] is it seems to me that we were aware of AIDS before Ted Weiss came into—here you have your first referral to AIDS in August of 1983. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I’m sure that we well before that had learned about it and actually had started discussing it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, maybe this is a task then for this summer for people to look into.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And, again, the way to figure that out is to take a look at the FY ’84 appropriation, and in that you want the Senate Committee Report, Labor, Health and Human Services appropriation.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>HHS. But ’84 is—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>In ’83, we would’ve been doing the FY ’84 appropriation. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh I see. Right, of course. We can do that. We can go back and take a look.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And I’d be happy to take a look at it. I would love to actually see it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay, we’ll see. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>My recollection is the way this came to our attention, there was a woman on our staff whose name is Riki Sheehan, and Riki was actually a Hatfield member. She was a former Hatfield staffer whom he had put on that Subcommittee and she did the appropriation for the CDC [Centers for Disease Control]. She came to me one day and she said, “Claudia, I have some very disturbing news that I picked up from my sources at CDC. It seems that the budget only recommends—” I think at the time it was $4 million for the CDC for AIDS research and she said that, “There’s a disease that they’re very concerned about out there called AIDS.” It was the autoimmune deficiency syndrome and they requested money, additional funds, from OMB that were denied, and she said, “And in checking, I believe that NIH [National Institutes of Health] has also been denied additional funds for this.” </p>
          <p>I said, “I think you should check it out and you should find out what it is and why they feel strongly about it.” And so we presented it to Senator Weicker and I think he talked then to Tony Fauci at NIH and I believe we had a hearing on it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Could you say that name again? Tony who?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Dr. Anthony Fauci, who’s the head of the Allergy and Infectious Diseases Institute at NIH and has been forever the lead person on AIDS. I think Lowell called Tony Fauci after Riki checked it out and gave him a memorandum and Tony confirmed everything that was in Riki’s memorandum, that indeed it was something that they were very concerned about, that it appeared to be a targeted population, predominantly among gay men, and also drug users, so we began to move from there. I can’t remember, but the incremental increases began to be huge once we—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The increases of the disease?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Not just the disease, but funding for the disease. Well beyond what the administration was willing to request for the disease. And part of that, again— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you think this was— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I think it was their philosophy. They saw it as a disease that affected a very small, very particular population, and it wasn’t worth spending money on it. Then we began to hear that, yes, it might affect the heterosexual population because of dirty needles, etc., and then there were a couple of notorious cases, one of which was in Connecticut of a young man who was a hemophiliac.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That was much later, wasn’t it?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No, I don’t think it was that much later. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, really? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I don’t think it was that much later. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. I know I have that. Is that in the timeline? It is. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, it could have been later, but we picked this up very early and provided a lot of additional funding. I think the initial funding for AIDS— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m trying to find it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>—was something like $23 million for the request from both NIH and for CDC. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You think the awareness of AIDS and working on it precedes 1983?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No, I don’t think it precedes ’83, because we were in the Subcommittee in ’83, but I think as far as the Senate timeline is concerned. It was earlier than August. That’s my only—I think we had begun to act on it by then.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. We will definitely—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>It’s true. There were all sorts of—once the disease was so-called “out of the closet,” once people began to be aware of it, there was this sort of general panic about bathhouses and lifestyle issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And allowing children to come to school. I certainly remember that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And you didn’t want to shake anyone’s hand who had AIDS, and at the same time, people were dying. At this time, the thing is, if you were infected with AIDS, it was a death sentence, and it was a very quick death. Ironically, Dan Bradley, who was the head of the Legal Service Corporation who I worked so closely with on saving Legal Services during this period of time, died of AIDS.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>As did Rock Hudson. And that gave it much— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, as did Rock Hudson. And then shortly after Lowell and I were married, Stewart McKinney died of AIDS, and Stewart was Lowell’s best friend. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh really? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Stewart represented the same congressional district that Lowell had represented and he was a moderate Republican.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I see. This is 1987. It says Stewart McKinney dies of AIDS, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Right, but I think earlier than that out there had been the case of a hemophiliac.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>There had. I wish I could find exactly when it was.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>It was written up in <span class="work-title">Ladies’ Home Journal</span> or <span class="work-title">Good Housekeeping</span> or something. His wife, a young woman, they were a young couple, wrote the article.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And it was a dirty needle situation, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>It wasn’t a dirty needle. It was a blood transfusion, and that’s when people began to get really upset.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course, because it could happen to anybody.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Right. Exactly. So that’s when it began being seen as something other than a gay men’s disease.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In these years when you’re struggling for this funding and all, what is the relationship between Lowell Weicker and Ronald Reagan as this is going on? Do they have any personal contact or connection with one another? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are they seeing each other at events of any sort?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No. Not really that I know of, other than perhaps the annual Republican Senators’ dinner for the President at the Library of Congress. I don’t know of much contact. I do know that we were the first in five years to get the appropriation bill through the Senate for Labor, Health &amp; Human Services. For five years we had not had a bill because of abortion language, and I have to, again, be careful about what I say on that because I’d have to read the debate to see how we finally resolved it, but basically in many respects I think the Senate caved to the House language on limiting abortion for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. I think we always reported the bill without the language and we managed to pass it in the Senate without the language frequently, but in order to get a bill back through the House, we would have to put it in the language and in conference is my recollection, and we lost people like Senator Hatfield on that issue. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So these are hugely important years when you are very engaged in the appropriations process. Very fundamental. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes. These were very—I mean, the four years that I spent on the Appropriations Committee I don’t think I remember ever working an eight-hour day. I was always at work early and I always worked until at least 7:00 at night preparing for hearings. Most of our meetings would have to take place after the hearing day ended and there was just a tremendous amount of preparation. I would write questions for hearings at home, get in early to make sure that they would be typed up in time for the hearing, and so these were very heady times. </p>
          <p>I am not aware of any personal relationship that Lowell had with Ronald Reagan. In fact, the only thing I could tell you, this was also around the time that the school prayer debate was going on, and if you remember, in Vanity Fair recently the Reagan diaries were released. There is that quote in Reagan’s diary that he was defeated on the constitutional amendment on school prayer in the Senate and Lowell Weicker was the ringleader as he is on so many things that we want and he is just a— I’m trying to think of the exact words—“a pompous, no-good fathead.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, exactly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>That was the quote, “a pompous, no-good fathead.” So there certainly wasn’t any love lost. At one point, during the debate or afterward, I guess, whenever it was that Reagan was shot, Lowell wrote him a personal note which said, “I’m keeping you in my thoughts and prayers,” and Reagan wrote him back thanking him for his kind note and he put a P.S. in his handwriting, and unfortunately this one has been lost, saying, “I didn’t know you prayed.” [laughter] So I think that’s probably the lightest moment in their relationship. </p>
          <p>Lowell was horrified when Reagan time after time after time submitted budgets which would cut programs for the disabled or oppose legislation that would expand the rights of disabled people. Reagan held a tenth anniversary celebration of the passage of PL 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, and Lowell was horrified by the hypocrisy of that and I think did not go. So unfortunately, I think Lowell always saw Reagan as a great communicator, but that the public who really loved him saw very little of this other side of him that was so callous about America being great, but not so great if you’re poor. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He says that in his book. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>His programs went right to the heart of all of these programs which would provide opportunity. Head Start—how do you cut Head Start? From all of the studies and all of the experience, children in Head Start programs do so much better than their peers who have not had that experience. These were all the issues that we dealt with.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, and they’re really center stage.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And they are center stage. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And the Senator is in a place to make a difference at that point in his career.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>They directly affect people’s lives, the quality of life. I think this is why I felt the Labor, Health &amp; Human Services budget was so important. Everything that I was raised to believe in probably from my Catholic upbringing is that you have a responsibility to help people who do not have the same opportunities you do, and this bill represented that responsibility. Bill Natcher, who was the conservative Democratic chairman from Kentucky referred to this bill, which he loved, as “the people’s bill,” and as conservative as he was, he was very generous in his deliberations on this bill because he saw probably more than anyone else—he had a much larger constituency probably in Kentucky that benefitted from these programs.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So which specific bill are we talking about?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Labor, Health &amp; Human Services, the people’s bill. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The bill of what? So it would be a particular year. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>The Appropriations bill. Oh, both years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, both years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Both years, because we faced the issue— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Each and every year. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>These issues were constant. They came up year after year, and it was like treading water, and in the end—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Saved a lot of programs.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="023506"></a>2:35:06</p>
          <p class="c-header">How the U.S. budget reflects the country’s priorities</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, we saved a lot of programs, but I think we helped to at least save how we define ourselves just as a country. I mean, our country’s priorities are reflected in the budget. I became persuaded of that when I finally did go to work for the Appropriations Committee. There’s plenty of legislating that goes on in an appropriation bill, as we know now, and the best advice that I got was from the Democratic staff person I replaced on State, Justice. He turned to me one day and he said, “You know, what you have to understand coming from an authorizing committee is that one law is as good as another,” and to me, it says everything, because we always did get the last word. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>They could authorize anything. I mean, you could authorize the moon, but it didn’t have to be funded, and that applied to many defense programs. They could be authorized, but they didn’t all have to be funded, and the same thing here. You could request ridiculously low numbers for AIDS research or really disabling amounts of appropriations for NIH during cuts in the NIH budgets, but then you’re changing, really, what has been a fundamental relationship in the United States in research between the NIH, the educational institutions, and the private sector, and all of this was seen as deregulatory, privatizing, limiting government control, limiting government waste.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Exactly what Reagan was loved for, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Sold as limiting government waste. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, sold as. Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>But the rhetoric’s a lot different than reality as to how it falls.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So these are incredibly important and heady years. Why do you leave?</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="023748"></a>2:37:48</p>
          <p class="c-header">Marriage to Lowell Weicker</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, I was divorced by then, by the end of that time, and I guess we had worked together long enough that I began seeing Senator Weicker and he asked me to marry him.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So how long of a period of a time was that between the time of—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Not long. Months. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really, wow. But you knew each other very well.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>We knew each other very well, and I didn’t always agree with him. [laughter] I still don’t. The only funny thing about it was when he actually asked me to marry him, he was very appropriate and he said, “Is there anyone I should talk to?” and I said, “You mean, like my father?” And here I was divorced with two children and he said, “Yes, I’ll talk to your father.” But I said, “Well, I actually think you should talk to Senator Hatfield.” [laughter] And he did. He went to see Mark Hatfield and told him. So at any rate—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you stopped working because—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I stopped working. I worked through 1984 and stopped right after because it was January. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You had all these children to take care of.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I had all these children to take care of, and blending a family to worry about, and if you asked me today, do I miss it? Absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Even today. Those years in the Congress were really great, and I particularly in those last several years felt that we really made a difference. There are not many people who actually get the satisfaction of doing that, because the legislative process outside of Appropriations is so ponderous and it can take years to—I mean, Ribicoff worked I don’t know for how many years to try to get the Department of Education bill passed, and it was only when Jimmy Carter endorsed it in his presidential campaign that he knew it was going to happen. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s really the alignment of the positions that allow you ultimately to make that difference. That’s what I’m understanding from all of this. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Having the right people on your staff, working with the other right people, but also just having the authority between serving on the Appropriations Committee and the Authorizing Committee at the same time there is a kind of juncture of possibilities.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>For him that certainly was, and also, to be honest with you, I think it was a very important period of time, also, for Lowell, because up until the time the Republicans took control of the Senate, Lowell was never one to really engage in leadership activities of the Republican Party. He was always a very independent operator. I’m sure he’ll go over all of this with you, but I think that what happened—people began to see something other than the so-called maverick who was willing to take the Senate floor on an issue that may not be popular, i.e., to stand up against a prayer in school amendment and to be willing to hold the floor indefinitely until people understood what it meant. That seemed like such an apple pie issue. </p>
          <p>People had always seen him as that maverick or the gadfly, the unpredictable member. You weren’t quite sure how he was going to come out, and if he could mess you up, it just might happen. But he never abandoned certain beliefs, and on Appropriations and Small Business, as well, I suppose, on all these committees, but more so on Appropriations, he had very important responsibilities to manage and he did it really well. He was seen as an administrator, as a leader. He had to lead a committee of, first, a subcommittee of seven maybe on State, Justice, and far more than that on Labor, Health &amp; Human Services, but get the consent of 29 people on a full committee, the majority of 29 people on a full committee, to move anything forward, and I think that was really— </p>
          <p>Those were his finest hours, because he was working against his own President frequently, and he wasn’t making friends within the administration on many of—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Indeed. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>—his proposals, and yet he was following through, I think, on something that he also had had engrained in him, which was it’s not necessarily his constituents in Greenwich who needed his help, but it was the poor people in Bridgeport, which he has said, obviously.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Bridgeport. Yes, indeed, he has.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>That’s where it all came together, and in order to do it, he had to be out front and he had to take a lot of political risks, and my feeling is part of the reason why he lost in 1988 is not because people didn’t respect him, but his brand of politics became tiring because it was so in-your-face all the time.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="024436"></a>2:44:36</p>
          <p class="c-header">Thoughts on Lowell Weicker’s legacy</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What do you think he will be most remembered for?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I think the disabilities legislation. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The Americans with Disabilities Act? Or—because he wasn’t actually in the Senate when that passes—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No, but he wrote it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>He wrote it, but I think it’s the accumulation of all of it. I don’t know if he told you that the President asked him to be on that National Council of Disabilities and he turned it down.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Our current President?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes. He did. He turned it down, for a variety of reasons. Not because he doesn’t want to serve the President, it just was a matter of timing at this point. So he is well known for his activities on disabilities. I think he will be forever remembered for the role he played in Watergate, and at some point history might remember the role he played on preserving these important social programs.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And the environment, right? That was an important initiative as well. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And the environment. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That was an important initiative as well, I think, in terms of—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>It is. Unfortunately, people still don’t pay enough attention to the oceans, and I think water is such an important factor going out. We have to deal with it. So that’s where I see his record.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So the social programs, but specifically education programs, research for health issues, disabilities, and the early stand he took for Watergate.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Watergate, and I don’t know that people will remember constitutional issues from years ago.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Maureen Byrnes in the interview I did with her really pushed that point.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>The constitutional issues?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. The way in which he valued the Constitution and the constitutional issues piece.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I don’t know. I think if people remember, if people care, and that’s where I have, I think, less faith with the public at large. Again, it’s just great to be able to say we have prayer in school, but it’s honestly a question of what prayer. I had an experience as a child—my best friend was a Jewish girl who lived around the corner who went to the public school. We were playing one day and she said, “I know what prayer you say,” and she proceeded to recite the Protestant version of “The Lord’s Prayer,” and I said, “But that’s not what prayer I say.” And she said, “Yes, it is.” I said, “No, it’s not. But why do you know this?” And she says, “Because we have to say it every day in school.” And I, as a seven-year-old, it bothered me. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You thought that was wrong, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Her grandmother had been through the Holocaust and had been in a concentration camp and still had the tattoo on her arms, and I once in a while would go over there. Her grandmother was Orthodox and I would turn on the lights for her. Anyway, but that’s an aside. They are important. </p>
          <p>I don’t disagree with Maureen. I think the thing about the constitutional issues—the Supreme Court guaranteed that women can have an abortion. The Republicans, the conservatives, took it away from a woman who was poor, took that right away because she can’t afford to pay for it. </p>
          <p>The Supreme Court said that there are remedies for desegregating schools. The Congress tried to take away some of those remedies. And then obviously there’s the prayer issue, and so I think these were important times because all of these issues were put out there as Christian issues belonging to our Judeo-Christian heritage.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Not busing.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Not busing. Well, busing had a different kind of justification, that it was somehow immoral to take little children on long bus trips away from their homes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s true. Right. I’d forgotten that piece.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="025018"></a>2:50:18</p>
          <p class="c-header">Jacob Javits gives public tribute to Lowell Weicker</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And that these judges are terrible and insensitive and Lowell did stand up for that and in 1984, I’m pretty sure it was 1984, Lowell was invited to Jacob Javits’s 80th birthday.<br>
            <br>
          <span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, right. I know this story, but please go ahead and tell it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And it wasn’t a big birthday. I went with him. It wasn’t a big birthday luncheon. It was at “21,” and people like Douglas Fairbanks and Barbara Walters were there. It was very close family and close personal friends, and after all of the comments by members of his family and his former law partner he responded, and he began his response—I mean, 90 percent of his response—but I’ll never forget the way he began it. This is a man in a wheelchair who literally is gasping after each partial sentence, who began by saying, “No one understands how cold a place the Senate can be when you choose to stand alone than Lowell Weicker.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s beautiful. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>And he went on to talk about Lowell’s courage and his conviction in standing up on issues that other people would run from, and it was incredibly moving. </p>
          <p>I looked at Lowell and he had tears coming down his cheeks because it was the least expected and it was just amazingly powerful, but that’s the role he assumed, whether it was in support of poor women getting abortions or being able to distribute clean needles to drug addicts so that we wouldn’t spread AIDS or to have an AIDS education program. Most of the people in the Senate were terrified to vote for these things. The votes were frequently 92 to 2, Lowell and Daniel Patrick Moynihan the only two people who’d be willing to stand up for clean needles.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, Ted Kennedy perhaps in terms of supporting—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Oh, yes, the support did come later. I mean, 92 to 6 sometimes. [laughter]   And then later, apartheid was amazing. Talk about something that no one expected to see in our lifetime, apartheid government of South Africa collapsing, and Lowell led the Republican opposition to Reagan’s veto of the sanctions legislation, Lowell and Ted Kennedy, and then Lowell is invited to go and see Nelson Mandela sworn in. </p>
          <p>I sat next to Nelson Mandela at Bill Clinton’s inauguration. Lowell was up on the dais and I was sitting in the audience and this nice looking man came and sat next to me and there was a woman with him who turned out was his staffer. When I realized who it was, I turned to him and I introduced myself and I said, “I’m Lowell Weicker’s wife,” and he remembered. He said, “Yes, I know the role your husband played with Senator Kennedy.” And I said, “My husband collects autographs. Would you please sign my program from the Clinton inauguration?” So that is up on the wall. “To Lowell.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>One last question. You know this man very well. Where do you think his courage came from, or comes from, to stand up to these issues without fear of personal consequence?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I think part of it is genetic. I think it’s genes and I think it’s the way he was probably raised. He was raised in a very privileged family, and yet from what I understand, his father absolutely instilled in him, and his mother as well, that there are responsibilities, that if you are privileged, you also have responsibilities to society. I mean, his father volunteering when he was too old and too tall for the Army Air Force during World War II and serving out five years in England, or four years, and giving up the presidency of Squibb to do that. And his mother, whose father was a British general, obviously knew the role of responsibility and service to country, and his mother was a great fan of Franklin Roosevelt. Obviously Lowell was, as well, growing up through World War II, so I think that. </p>
          <p>I think that he was raised by a family and learned growing up early that there’s nothing you cannot do. I think that was inbred, but yet you’re expected to do certain things, and it was always a matter of giving back. He wasn’t always moderate. He was pretty conservative when he came to Congress as a congressman. The thing that always horrifies me is that he introduced or he co-sponsored that resolution of Gerald Ford’s to impeach William O. Douglas.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Yes, you should ask him about that. He did. And there he was, sort of a young congressman, and— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Quickly overshadowed by Watergate.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, quickly overshadowed, I think, by the realities of the people who came from outside of his immediate neighborhood, the people in Bridgeport and the people who really did need help, and also being from Connecticut, it’s a very diverse ethnic constituency with lots of blue collar, minority population, older cities that are failing. You begin to see, to take a good look at that. Not everybody works on Wall Street and lives in Greenwich. </p>
          <p>So when I did marry him, he drove me to the town hall to register to vote and he said, “I’m not going to go in with you.” He said, “The only thing I will tell you, Claudia, is that I have a lot of problems with the Republican Party.” So I did for the first time ever register as a Republican, but as soon as he lost in 1988, I went back to being a Democrat. [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I guess you didn’t have too much choice, did you?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>No. It was the only thing he’s ever really indicated that I should do. [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, thank you so much for all this time. This has really been—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Well, it’s good. It’s good for me, too. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s wonderful to have your impressions on tape.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>I would like to take a look if you can get at any of the reports.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I will try to do that, and maybe at some point we’ll sit down again, just more briefly.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Can you access Lexis or the Library of Congress?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, we can.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>You can?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, I’m sure we can. Whether you can do this from home or whether I need to do it for you, I don’t really know, but—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Because that’s probably the way for me to do it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, in any case, let me just say that perhaps we should find a time before this project is done just to round things out for you to talk some about your role as the first lady of Connecticut, if you’d like to. If not, that’s okay, but, anyway, if we do that, we’ll reserve it for another day. So for right now, I’m going to say thank you again, and that will officially end this portion of the interview. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">C. Weicker: </span>Great. </p>
