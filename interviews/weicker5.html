          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Today is January 12, 2011. This is the sixth and final interview with Lowell Weicker in the Lowell Weicker Oral History Project, and today I proposed that we talk about your strong commitment to preservation of the Constitution and constitutionality and the legislative process. You have said this multiple times, and I thought it would be terrific if we could just explore some of those constitutional issues that you’ve been so committed to. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000043"></a>0:00:43</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s immersion in Constitutional issues through Watergate</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I think that I start off with the point where I took constitutional law at the University of Virginia taught by Lindsey Cowen, and I only got a 2.0, so obviously I didn’t excel at it the time that I was in my course of studies. That said, along came Watergate, and all of a sudden it immersed everybody, certainly members of the Committee, into the Constitution of the United States. I think if you’ll read my supplementary views at the end of Watergate you’ll see how I link all of the events to violations of the Constitution. That really is the main thrust of what I tried to accomplish in my additional views. In other words, each member of the Committee did or did not take advantage of the opportunity to express his own points of view on the Watergate—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>These are the Watergate hearings?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, these are the Watergate hearings, and if you’ll go into the Committee report, that said every member of the Committee also had the opportunity to add to that report his own views, and mine strictly dealt with linking the various abuses committed by Richard Nixon and his people to the Constitution of the United States. I say that because that pretty much explains my statement that I learned the Constitution to an even greater extent during Watergate than I did in my academic course at the University of Virginia, and I think that was true, very frankly, of the entire country. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you remember actually going back to the Constitution and studying its clauses during that period?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, sure. If, indeed, the President committed wrongs, it wasn’t a matter of opinion or a matter of politics or philosophy. You had to clearly associate those wrongs with either laws, or in this case, for me, the Constitution. I think this is terribly important because I think that the whole country at that stage of the game refamiliarized itself with the Constitution of the United States, more specifically what a President of the United States could or couldn’t do. That’s pretty well delineated in the Constitution.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it went back to the Article 2 with the executive powers.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, sure, it goes right to that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s what you were looking at?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>As I said, rather than waste your time here, my report is a very succinct report and strictly relates the Constitution and the various provisions of the Constitution to the wrongdoing that was committed by Nixon and his staff, and I can’t informally give you a better rundown than that which exists in those documents. I wish I had the report here. I don’t. It’s all packed up or it’s all over at the University. </p>
          <p>I noticed, for example, that in the book that was written on the Constitution by Page Smith, they clearly point out in there how Watergate impacted upon the country when it came to reacquainting itself with the Constitution of the United States. And even now, to this day, since Watergate, you hear more often the expression when it comes to a law or a particular activity, “Is it constitutional?” You didn’t hear that all that much prior to Watergate. Boy, since Watergate, you sure do. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s interesting.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I’m not saying among lawyers you always haven’t had that, but among the public, “Is it constitutional?” So that is where I got my love for the document, and it led me obviously to other matters during the course of my career. A good example would be church and state.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, absolutely. I want to talk about that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>A hugely important subject.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I want to talk about that. But let me just back up for a moment and ask you—I’ve read some of the things you’ve written. I think you gave me a piece one of our other times, this one is based on this talk that you gave at the Clark Center on the Constitution. In that you say that the Constitution is a never-finished ideal. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s true.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You don’t actually ever say whether you view yourself as a loose or strict constructionist or indeed whether you even think that those terms are meaningful, and I thought maybe I would just start in general by asking you.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Sure, I think they’re meaningful. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Meaningful in terms of your own views, because obviously “the Constitution is a never-finished ideal,” means it’s a changing document and has to be fit to the circumstances of the time.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Which is why you have the Supreme Court.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And on the other hand you often go back to the Founding Fathers and their views, which is perhaps what the strict constructionists subscribe to.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000721"></a>0:07:21</p>
          <p class="c-header">The Constitution and the right to bear arms</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I can have my viewpoint, but really the ultimate viewpoint is that which is stated by the Supreme Court. I mean nobody would disagree more with the Supreme Court than I do on their latest interpretation of the right to bear arms. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think their latest ruling is a travesty. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So they are the final arbiter. I understand that, but then, of course, the Congress makes the laws, which then get ruled on by the courts, so it’s a constant art of working with the Constitution. I know the Supreme Court’s the final arbiter, but on the other hand, as you say, the Supreme Court can be wrong, in which case the Congress will come back and make new laws, which then will go through the court system and be tested yet again.  Right?</p>
<p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Right. So your point?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The point is that you have this constant balancing act and compromise, I think, between the three different powers of government, and there’s always an issue of interpretation, and I’m not a constitutional lawyer, either. I’m not a lawyer at all, but I think that the claim is often made that if you’re a strict constructionist you try to go back and understand exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind, and you base your views of what the Constitution says on that more than on the kind of loose construction concept, which is that we have to think of the document as changing over time.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, no. I mean, I don’t think it’s quite that simple. I think it wouldn’t make any difference whether you’re a conservative or a liberal. I think you understand there are limitations to how you can interpret the document, but you are trying to make it relevant to the times, and that’s where sometimes I think things have gone horribly astray. Nothing to me when I read, “a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state and the right of a people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” </p>
          <p>I know that that was written at a time when there was no standing army, navy, or air force. There was a militia, and obviously, if you have a militia, you have to have arms. Could I in my highest, in the loftiest flight of imagination imagine that you could say that applies to all 300 million-plus of us in the United States? My answer would clearly be no, since we now no longer have a militia but rather we have standing armed forces, and yet it’s been interpreted that it does apply to all 300 million of us to go walking around with weapons. I find that pretty—that’s a reach. That’s a real reach. I haven’t seen too many of those, but I would consider myself, I suppose, actually more in the strict constructionist camp than I would using it for any purpose whatsoever. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Because you really want to go back to what the intent was initially, and the intent has to be based on the circumstances of those times. Even though the circumstances change, it’s the intent behind it, actually what you’ve explained about the way in which you—</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001119"></a>0:11:19</p>
          <p class="c-header">Importance of separation of church and state</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I take it in its commonsense setting, I guess, is the best way to put it. When I read, “Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,” to me, it means what it says, that government does not get involved with religion, and I don’t have to go into all the refinements of that. That’s basically the way I view it. It’s the way [Thomas] Jefferson viewed it, to use his expression, “a wall of separation between church and state.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are you reading from the first amendment now?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. And to say that in any way we’re trying to restrict religion in the United States is outrageous because it’s the exact opposite. We’re encouraging all religions to flourish in the United States, and the proof of the pudding is in what’s happened. All religions flourish in the United States. And I use it because it’s a good example because I spent too many hours on the floor arguing with Jesse Helms on this point.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You did. I’ve gone over that this morning.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>But, you know, to say, “What’s wrong with a prayer in school?” There’s plenty wrong with it. Number one, if you have a very fervent belief in whatever, you’re offended by the fact that in order to be constitutional apparently you have to have a “to whom it may concern” prayer. People don’t believe that. They have their own faiths. They have the Jewish faith and Muslim or Christian, and within the Christian, obviously, different sects and one thing or another. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Or an atheist.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Or an atheist, yes, right. So it’s offensive and it flies directly in the face of this amendment, and the interesting thing as I’ve said before is the worst examples of government have been when you’ve merged government with religion. Invariably, occasions when either the religion is weak or the government is weak they try to push the two things together and then all hell breaks loose. I have made a point of saying that—  well, let me carry it to the extreme. I don’t even believe, and as a matter of fact, I noticed just the other day, I think, it was declared unconstitutional in some place a national day of prayer. Why? Why? For what reason? That’s not something that should be sanctioned by the government. </p>
          <p>Listen—as one who comes from a devout Anglican background with my great uncle having been the Archbishop of Canterbury, I firmly believe in the Anglican or Episcopalian, in my case, Episcopalian, form of worship and articles of faith, but for me to go ahead and say that’s it and that’s what should be practiced by everybody else, I think flies right in the face of that Constitution. </p>
          <p>As I say, to me the greatest arguments in this regard were set forth by [James] Madison in his “Remonstrance” when the Virginia legislature tried to pass a law providing for a tax to be distributed to preachers of the Anglican faith, and Madison clearly sets forth example after example as to why it’s a bad idea, but the main one being the fact that because we have this in our Constitution, all faiths come to the United States. At that time, they were trying to populate the country, quite frankly, and it was a tremendous attraction to get people to come live in the United States. Well, to follow through on that, they did come and they’ve been coming and they’re bringing their own faiths and they can all practice their own faiths.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, you also make the point that when people initially came and the original states were set up, there were religious prescriptions, and Madison was objecting to that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, well, he was, because for him, it was Anglican in Virginia. In the state of Connecticut, it was Congregationalism. If you weren’t a Congregationalist, you were in tough shape. And don’t forget, it was to a congregation of Baptists that Jefferson wrote his letter—Baptists in Danbury, Connecticut—which encompassed the expression, “a wall of separation between church and state.” No, I think that there’s nothing very complex about the way the Constitution’s written. Common sense tells you exactly what it says. It does not say you shouldn’t believe. It does not say there’s no such thing as a supreme being, but you’re to find your own way to whatever you believe, without the guidance of government. That’s what it’s about. </p>
          <p>So to me, I suppose you could say I’m a strict constructionist, but I can also see where broad principles such as I’ve just dwelled upon can also have ramifications in the modern society, other portions of the Constitution, but I think those two—the matter of the militia and the matter of religion—illustrate really where I’m coming from as to my own philosophy on the document, because I can do it in a simple way. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001738"></a>0:17:38</p>
          <p class="c-header">View of the first amendment of the Constitution</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Now, if you go on in the first amendment, all of a sudden you come across this thing which has been tested of late, “or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or of the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition government for redress of grievances.” </p>
          <p>That’s pretty common sense to me; fine, if you have something to say, you have every right to get up there and say it and make your view known. Does it include spitting on people or desecrating their funerals or yelling invective during a town hall meeting by a congressperson? No, it certainly does not, and it certainly doesn’t include being able to bear arms to such a meeting. Common sense tells me that. Why do you think somebody used the words “peaceably assemble”? Peaceably assemble includes bringing arms? Not by any definition, so I think in answer to your question, again I repeat, I think I just apply common sense to what the Constitution means, understanding that you don’t just leave it where it was when it was written, but certainly in the broadest possible sense, it means what it says.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That first amendment includes freedom of speech and freedom of religion, and what do you do when people argue, they butt heads. That is, I think a lot of the discussion in the 1980s over prayer in school focused on the freedom of speech piece and the right to assemble. So if you had a voluntary group that wanted to assemble in schools for the purpose of prayer, that butted heads with the issue of whether you should allow religion in schools, at least that’s the way I read a lot of the discussion and conflict about constitutionality that went on during that period.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, boy. To me, it was always a matter of enunciating a specific prayer. That’s where the issue came, really, and more and more, it’s not—you know as well as I do in the public schools it was the Protestant prayer is what it was. It wasn’t the Jewish prayer. It certainly wasn’t the Catholic prayer. It was basically a Protestant prayer, and as I say, to use public facilities to do that obviously crosses the line. Look, the example that you’ve used, again, you’re making me dig too deep here. It’s getting to be a really strained exercise.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m sorry. I don’t mean to do that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>But I remember very clearly, if you don’t think for one minute—are you talking about the silent prayer? I don’t have a problem with a person who wants to pray silently, and if you don’t think that kids in school sit there praying that they’re going to get a hundred on an examination— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You’re damned right they do. They’re doing it quietly in their own way. I don’t have a problem with that. It doesn’t bother me, so to say that you can’t do this except that it has to be vocal and heard by everybody else, it’s just plain nonsense. </p>
          <p>I even used to use the example—I know I’m rambling—but you’re bringing together all the various arguments that I used when I was in this debate. I used the example in my own faith, the Christian faith; if anybody of Christian belief wants to read their Bible, all they have to do is read that section which enunciates the Lord’s Prayer. The surrounding language to the Lord’s Prayer is Jesus saying, “And go into your room—” I’m paraphrasing—“close the door and say quietly, in the other words, the Lord’s Prayer. Don’t be like the Pharisees wearing their religion on their sleeve.” So even in the instructions from Jesus in my faith are to do it by yourself and quietly and not to proclaim yourself to the world. </p>
          <p>If the United States would concentrate on the problems which government can deal with, and that’s not a person’s inner faith, believe me, we’ll take a big step forward. We’ve got enough to do in that area without rumbling around and trespassing on what is a private matter for, I think, everybody.</p>
          <p>I find it really offensive. As you know, religion has increasingly crept its way into our politics and into our government and no good has come of it. Absolutely none. None. And even if you scan history, everybody’s down on the Muslims right now. I attended an interfaith dinner about six, nine months ago in Hartford with the Muslim community and I must confess, there were wonderful representatives there from the Jewish faith and the Catholic faith and others, the Episcopal faith. It was about health care. Well, you see, what most people don’t realize is that health care has been a huge priority for Muslims since the beginning of time. Indeed, the great physicians way back when came from the Muslim faith and health care has been enormous. So when I see Muslims portrayed in the way of being terrorists, etc., yes, I’m sure there are, just as during the Crusades there were Christian terrorists roaming around the Middle East killing Muslims and Jews alike. That makes my point to just let it alone. </p>
          <p>In other words, let people do what they do, and as long as you don’t merge it into a governmental exercise, you’re going to come out to a good end. But there’s so much to be learned, I think, both from history and from our own experience as a nation in keeping the two apart and not allowing the religion to get into the politics or the governing of the United States. It has made us unique, and it’s one of the diversities that’s made us strong. We’re strong also because of our ethnic diversity, of our racial diversity. All these things have made us the strongest nation on earth, and when we start clamping down on any aspect of it, we’re going to lose that diversity and we’ll lose our claim to being the most powerful nation in the world.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It sounds to me that you’re making the argument that the wall between church and state should be separated from this principle of freedom of speech.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, sure.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That the freedom of speech clause did not mean to apply to this issue—that is, there’s sort of a convoluted effort to introduce prayer in school, calling it a freedom of speech issue. Is that where you’re coming down on this?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I’ve never really heard it coined in the freedom of speech. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That way?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know I’ve gone over this more recently than you have, but in 1983, for example, Mark Hatfield introduced what was called the Religious Speech Protection Act, and I think that’s what Helms was arguing was the constitutional principle to allow prayer in school, that people should have the freedom of speech to pray, to have a moment of prayer or something of that sort.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>But they have that freedom right now. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Just not formalized.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They have in an informal way. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>What was the analogy I was going to use? It’s redundant. It’s like I say to people when they ask me the question, “Are you for term limits?” I said, no. “Why?”  Why would I want to go ahead and reduce the power that I presently have to kick somebody out of office? That power is immediate. Why do I want to be told there should be limits on the number of terms? You can’t do any better than the power that I’ve got right now, if I choose to exercise it, which is to go to the polls and vote and kick them out, so please don’t tell me you’re giving me anything that I don’t presently have. I have it. And the same holds true for me of freedom of speech, freedom of religion. I don’t cross the two. I really don’t.</p>

          <p class="c-header">Views on school busing</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You also came down very strongly and fought very hard on the issue of school busing. So what was the constitutional principle there behind your thinking? A lot of people tied it to the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the Constitution as to whether it’s constitutional for there to be busing to achieve integration.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Phyllis, I really can’t give you an off-the-top-of-my-head on that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Was it Kim Elliott who worked a lot of those issues?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. I know I opposed it, but you’re asking me for the constitutional basis, and that’s what I’m having a hard time coming to grips with. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I think it’s probably the fourteenth amendment, which calls for the equal protection of laws and the notion that equal education was part of the equal protection of the laws, right? And you can’t have equality without busing to achieve it, given—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I’m not so sure that’s the way my reasoning went. I mean—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think a lot of people tied it also to the fifth amendment, which is due process, but due process is very vague. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You’re talking about a remedy here. I’d have to refresh my memory on that. How do you remedy, for example—this is the problem you’ve got now, that the segregation is not racial, it’s economic—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>—and therefore—but being economic, it becomes racial. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>These are very sophisticated problems. I don’t want to just pump something out of my head right now. I’d have to go and look—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But weren’t the arguments in Congress at the time and in the Senate over the legality of busing? They were clearly tied to—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>They were tied to the court. In other words, that the court could not order that. That’s probably where my basis—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that would be a separation of powers issue?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, in other words, this is I think where I came down, and as a matter of fact, as you know, Helms specifically tried to go ahead and prohibit the Supreme Court—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Absolutely.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>—from issuing busing directives, so my guess is that my opposition to this came more in that area than it did relating it to any specific amendment. That’s why I’m being cautious in how I respond because I knew there had to be some link, but I think that’s where the link came, that it was not up to Congress to tell the courts what they could do in terms of remedy. </p>
          <p>And, again, I repeat, in other words, in all these instances, there’s sound common sense advice that emanates from the Constitution depending on what the situation is. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And on the abortion— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I wish I had my Watergate— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—testimony. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>—my separate views on that, but that’s a classic lesson, I think, in relating the Constitution to modern-day events.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I’m glad you said that, because we do have the papers, and anybody who listens to this interview will know where to find those views, and so that’s, I think, what’s most important right now.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s where you find—I know, for example, “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses and papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.” Well, what does that bring to mind? Obviously, it brings the [Daniel] Ellsberg situation, and that was argued there.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>and the good thing about the Watergate hearings was Sam Ervin was a constitutional scholar, so he brought that element to play in our hearings. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who do you think, as you look back, were the most important people who worked with you to support your view on these issues that had these constitutional implications? So on the Watergate, we’ve been over that before.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Certainly Bill Shure was, Searle Field was, Stan Twardy was. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m talking about other members of Congress, actually, who you feel were really important in helping to making the case.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s a tough one. I mean, for example, it’s easy for me. If it’s on separation of church and state, it would’ve been John Danforth, himself an Episcopal minister, feeling as strong as I do on separating the two. Certainly you’d have to name John in that respect. Gosh, Phyllis, that’s a tough one.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m asking you to go for kind of a detail.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Obviously, Ted Kennedy. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I – </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s hard to recall specifics.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It is. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You said Sam Ervin?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Certainly you should say Sam Ervin, no question about that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Let me ask a different question. I was trying to think through this morning what would probably be the biggest constitutional issues in your career that you’ve really identified yourself with. Religious freedom clearly seems to be very important. Separation of powers – </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—seems to be very important. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Equal protection of the laws, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s a third one. What about the distinction between—in the tenth amendment, the powers that are reserved to the states that are not specifically— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No, that never was a big area of mine. The one that comes to mind there to me one day will be delineated. At the present time, 50 states have the right to have 50 different requirements when it comes to voting in the state. In other words, you have 50 different laws telling you how you can be a presidential candidate on a state ballot. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s problematic. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I think there ought to be one requirement. Since it’s one office for the United States, there ought to be one requirement for every state and not 50 different sets of requirements that make it impossible for an Independent to go ahead and effectively run unless you have a ton of money and a barrel full of lawyers. I think some day that we’ll come to an understanding on the administrative aspects of an election. I have no problem with every state setting its own requirements, but not for the office of President of the United States.</p>

          <p class="c-header">States’ rights and gay marriage</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What about rights to marriage? Should that be nationally determined, or should that be—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No, I don’t think that should be nationally determined.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But there are implications. Let’s say—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, sure. There are. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>There are implications in terms of moving from state to state and then health care and then— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>There are. And maybe it’ll come to pass, but I think that’s a long way down the line. And I say that as one who’s very proud of my state of Connecticut. The supreme court of the state, most of which were put in there during my term of office, made gay marriages legal with all the benefits attendant thereto, so it’s not a question that I don’t understand the depth of people on this matter of marriage, but I think you’re going to have a hard time convincing the states to move on that area. I can see moving a lot faster in the area of President.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003757"></a>0:37:57</p>
          <p class="c-header">War powers and the executive branch</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I would also assume that a big issue for you would be the war-making authority within the executive branch.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. The War Powers Act. That was all done with Jack Javits, and it’s all written down there. There’s nothing more I can say. The problem with many of the things that we’re covering now is it took a lot of detailed study and thought on my part, and to try to go back—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And remember—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>To just do it right now, that gets to be—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s too much. Okay.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>—pretty tough. I mean, it’s all down there in black and white, and War Powers was a huge event. The problem is that the event has disappeared from view and we’re really right back to square one on how we go to war around here. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Indeed. Right. So looking forward, what do you see right now as the biggest challenges to the Constitution that are on the table in terms of the way the government is functioning, in terms of the parties that are forming, in terms of the values that are being expressed nationally?</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003918"></a>0:39:18</p>
          <p class="c-header">The importance of teaching the Constitution</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think the biggest problem confronting us is the failure of the American people as a whole to understand our origins in terms of both the Declaration and the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. If you asked me what is the one thing you’d like to have happen, it’s to make it mandatory, at an age which can properly absorb it, the reading and understanding of those documents. They’ve gone totally out the window and everybody thinks they can just do ad hoc type of running of our government.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How would you make it mandatory? Would it require a Constitutional amendment? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>A requirement that every school, public and private, teach it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So as an amendment to the Constitution? How would you do this?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. You can certainly do a lot by federal funding. There’s no question about that. I mean, I just think—never mind how. You ask me what needs to be done, not how would I do it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, I agree. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s what needs to be done, because that’s to me at the basis of all of our present discontent. If at a young age people understand the values that are put forth in those documents, I don’t worry for our future. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The problem is the people who are teaching those values have to—like the second amendment, you can interpret that—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Like the first amendment. What’s the phrase that Madison used—“that we take alarm at this first experiment on our liberties—” talking about religious freedom. We don’t take alarm at any of these things that happen within a very sound commonsense structure. I’m not asking that these things be taught with a particular philosophical bent, but just that they be taught. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>More often than not, the truth will get through and the right conclusions will be reached, but when there’s no knowledge of it all, God help us. This is not just one rally on the green. There obviously have to be rules, and those rules are pretty lofty in terms of their idealism and the promise that they hold, but when people know nothing about them, that’s a sad problem. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I absolutely agree with that and I know that my own understanding and memory of details gets fuzzy. It happens to all of us, so repeated review is a very good thing. But I don’t know how you create that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And the history around it is so dramatic. I tell people, for example, if you want to have fun at all this, go get the DVD 1776. It was a great musical, but also you understand that our Declaration, our Constitution, were written by human beings and they had very many of the same debates and conflicts that we have today. They found a way around them and then the soaring eloquence of these documents. It’s got to inspire anybody that reads it unless all of a sudden you want to sort of drift down into a McDonald’s type of language to make your point. You know, “I’m lovin’ it.” </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And there is the English language. I think one of the greatest subtractions that occurred in our educational system has been that after Sputnik, everybody thought we’ve all got to go into the sciences and electronics, the biologies, the physics, and English language and history just went out the window. Come on. You don’t have an education unless—if you don’t understand history, believe me, you’ve got a long, dry spell ahead of you or a rough road to hoe, and English, the ability to express yourself and your basic thought, to me, these are hugely important parts of any education. Well, you know just as well as I do that’s not where education’s at today. It’s in the technical aspects of life. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But there are these efforts that are made to say that at certain levels of the educational spectrum you have to have certain kinds of knowledge. No Child Left Behind, whatever you think of that act, certainly said that there were benchmarks that people needed to meet, and those include benchmarks in English as well as in mathematics. It’s just very hard to implement, I think, in terms of really—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I just think we need more of the liberal arts, quite frankly, in our education process. I really do. I’m not degrading the sciences. For God’s sakes, we all understand exactly how valuable that is. It’s not so much they’re being out front as it is the others being left behind.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. And we’re emphasizing the sciences and maths much more now. Even in the higher education areas we’re doing that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I know.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Especially in the higher education areas. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I know. And again I repeat, if I can get people to read the Declaration and the Constitution—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you have a huge number of people now coming into office, it seems to me, who wouldn’t share your particular ideas.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, absolutely. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So the question is how do you change the current environment, and you can say, well, it starts with education, but—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Maybe it should start just with civility. God Almighty, even that’s just totally out the window.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It is. Are you optimistic about the future of the country, or do you fear for it? [Weicker pauses to think about this.]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>My answer to that is I don’t like to see us acting like an old nation and we are. It’s almost as if we feel that we’ve done everything we can—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We’re acting like an old nation?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, like an old nation. We’ve done it all. And we haven’t. To me—that’s why I took time to answer your question. No, I’m not pessimistic. I don’t fear for our future. I only fear for the fact that we are timid to attack the future with creativity and with boldness. There’s so much to be done out there, and again, I’m just using the common sense parameters. </p>
          <p>The violent rhetoric and the negativism about a health care plan for the United States. What’s the big deal here? The fact is that there are 48 million Americans that have none. There’s the fact that there are a whole bunch of Americans that have it, but it’s totally inadequate for the circumstances. I can go right on down the list. We should be creative enough to know that something needs to be done. I’m not saying the bill that was recently passed is perfect. It’s not. But to just go ahead and condemn it out of hand and say we don’t need that. Yes, you do. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you think we’ve become a more selfish nation?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, sure. I don’t think there’s any question about that. And again, history tells you that any nation that gets to the point where it’s on top of the heap, the way to stay there is through armed conflict. That’s nonsense. Take a look right on our borders. Haiti, for God’s sake. How can we live with our huge riches and see this festering sore that really hasn’t gotten much better since they went through their latest contortion, and they’ve been through them throughout history. I mean, there is a task to set yourself to.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What should we be doing in Haiti? If you were in the Senate now, what would you be encouraging?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>To make sure that the funds for rebuilding the infrastructure and of health care, those two. I’m not saying that education’s not important, but I think those first two have to be done now. They’re the most immediate. </p>
          <p>All I’m trying to point out is that there are many challenges throughout the whole world, and instead of paying attention to what the real challenges are, we have to feel that we’re going to be macho if we prevail in the military sense. Now, I’m not anti-military. I served in the military. I’m proud of the military. I understand we’ve got to be strong, but do we have to go racing off to every corner of the world to flex our muscle? The answer is absolutely no, and it’s killing us economically so that we can’t do the things that we’re supposed to be doing, both at home and abroad. And that’s why I say, in other words, we’re acting like a mature, great power, and I don’t think we’ve anywhere near reached our maturity. We have the capacity to do a great deal more in a positive way. <br>
          </p>
          <p>I think it’s very instructive to note, and I think you’ve heard me say this before, but it’s a very good example. There was that time that we all feared that Cuba would use its influence in the western hemisphere through military means to bring other governments under its sphere of influence, and that was certainly true when you had Ché Guevara running around and other adventuresome Cuban militaristic types, but the fact is the greatest gains that they’ve made in our hemisphere come from their exportation of medicine, of science, of doctors and nurses. That’s been huge, and it’s the reason why they’re respected in South America. It has nothing to do with their military might. Well, come on. As much as I respect Cuba and its medicine, I’d say that we’re far ahead of them, and what do we do with ours? We’re not doing that, so that’s what I mean by opportunities that are missed insofar as the future is concerned.</p>
          <p>Obviously, there’s a good deal more work to be done here at home. We all understand that, but we don’t have the resources, because again, they’re sapped by our military adventures around the world to take care of the problems right here at home. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you feel that [Barack] Obama’s hands have been tied by the Congress?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Now, look. He’s having a tough time, but let’s face it, that really goes with the turf. He wanted the job. I can’t complain about my governorship of Connecticut. I knew what I was getting into and I knew that probably I’d be reviled for doing the things that had to be done, but nobody’s forcing anybody to run for office in the United States. </p>
          <p>I think Obama’s problems have been sometimes disconcerted by rather minor issues that really don’t relate to the main problems confronting the United States. My only real sorrow with Obama has been I just wish Ted Kennedy had lived long enough to be by his side. I think he would have given great counsel to Obama that would have been invaluable in weaving his way around the highways and byways of political Washington. I can understand why he very soon fell into the trap of listening to the business-as-usual crowd in D.C.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It just seems to me he campaigned on some of these values that you’re talking about in terms of establishing America abroad in a very different kind of way.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Which he’s done.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And then being drawn into the Afghanistan war and more money for the military.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>All that stuff came to pass, and I will say this. Yes, I think the world far more respects the United States today than it did in the past. That said, the world is now, I think, beginning to get impatient again as we continue to act as we did before. I have great hope, though. I still do. I think that I’m not one of those that said I made a mistake in backing him. I didn’t. I like him. I think he’s got the right instincts, and certainly I prefer his type of governing than that of the Republicans at the present moment. I’m trying to think of other things that we haven’t covered. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Thoughts about U.S. immigration policy</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What do you think the constitutional issues are related to this immigration debate that we’re having today?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s a hard one. That’s a really tough problem. I obviously belong to the school that encourages people to come and settle in the United States, so I’m not in any way—again, to me, that’s a good example of being an old nation and trying to close the doors now that we’ve got to where we are. I think we still ought to have our doors wide open. Can I legitimize illegal immigration? No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But what about the possibility of working out arrangements for the children of illegal immigrants, which seems to—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, if they’re born in the United States, to me, they’re citizens.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What happens if they come with their parents at a very young age and they’ve lived their whole lives in the United States?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>This is the gray area that you get into. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Exactly.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And you certainly don’t want to go ahead and have the children suffer in any event because of it. It’s a very difficult area. It would require, it seems to me, the most bipartisan effort, nonpolitical effort, to resolve this problem, and if somebody thinks they’re going to make capital off of it, Christ, they’ll never arrive at a solution that makes sense. Now, I know, and everybody does, I understand. I understand. But that really requires some getting together of heads. That’s a very, very tough problem. I don’t have any ideas on how that can be easily resolved at this juncture. I don’t. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, it’s probably not going to be resolved in the next two years. Maybe this should be the last question. What do you think is going to happen in terms of governing over the next two years? You think we’re just going to be looking at a stalemate, or do you think that we’re going to be able to move some of the current issues of health care and immigration forward? How do you see that direction for the next couple of years?</p>

          <p class="c-header">Benefits of having third party candidates</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>You see, this is why I really believe that the solution of many of our present problems politically is to permit third-party candidacies—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Ah, good.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>—because it’s competition. And right now, the Republicans and Democrats simply have a duopoly going in this country, and I don’t care whether it’s duopolies or monopolies, they never produce anything good.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I read someplace where you said we’ve deregulated everything in this country except the political system.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>That’s right, and the only way you solve that is to give people a choice. Now, you’re seeing that to a far greater extent at the local level, at the state level, but you’re not going to really come to grips with this.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What about the Tea Party? Is that a third party?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No, that’s not a third party. What it is, it’s the far right of the Republican Party, and that’s doesn’t fool me at all. They’re not the solution; they’re the problem. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But some people are claiming they’re basically a third party.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I know, but I ran into Tea Party people when I was up in Connecticut this past summer and I’d go to radio broadcasts, and Christ, they’d be standing out there. I’ve never seen such a bunch of nut cases in my life as they were. There were all sorts of strange looking people saying strange things, and no, I don’t think that’s it. </p>
          <p>I think you could very well have an independent figure run nationally, assuming they had the money for it. I said early on, and I called him early on it, well over a year ago, I told Michael Bloomberg he ought to do that. He has the money, and very frankly, I think he’s a very sound, centrist type of individual, regardless of his latest snow-clearing effort in New York. But he’s the type of person that has the name recognition, and he has the money, which I referred to earlier, necessary to do the job, because he’s going to have to get lawyers to put him on the ballot in 50 states and it’s going to take lawyers, not voters. </p>
          <p>But to show it’s not something just that’s a pipedream, don’t forget—when Ross Perot ran, he really made both the Republicans and the Democrats sit up and take notice, specifically to balance the budget, which neither one of them had pledged themselves to, and then he got on that subject and the American people liked it and both the Republican and the Democrat pledged themselves. I think Clinton, as a matter of fact, was the one that produced, finally, the balanced budget. He was forced into that by Perot.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you’re really arguing that a third party candidate or an Independent Party would force both Republicans and Democrats to compromise.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s the way it should be going.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Absolutely.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think that’s interesting. But it requires an amount of money, especially because of, again, recent Supreme Court rulings and the capacity of lobbyists to fund so many people now without these candidates even having to say where their funds are coming from, so it’s privileging those people in America with just enormous amounts of money.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>And that, of course, brings you to the other point as to how do you conduct an election so money isn’t such a part of it. I’ve said all along and I continue to say, you’ve got to use time. You use time as the equalizer.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What do you mean by that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, by that I mean that no money can be raised—in other words, I don’t doubt that money’s free speech, so I’m not conflicting with the Supreme Court on that. I think money is free speech, but what you can do is say that no money can be given or money can be spent except within a period of time, using time as the regulator. Now, you can say, “Well, Lowell, it’s still possible to go ahead and give to Phyllis Leffler within a period of six weeks, let’s say, for the election.” It’s possible to give Phyllis $10 million. Well, yes. But then it’ll look like what it is—buying an election. So I don’t worry about that. </p>
          <p>There will be those rare instances, but they will certainly be highlighted, whereas what it will actually do, I think, is obviously tone down the whole amount of money that’ll be contributed into the various campaigns. I think time is the issue here, that our elections be shortened, and they’ll be shortened if indeed you limit the time in which money can be raised and money can be spent. So it’s in areas like that. I think we have to come to grips with the actual mechanisms of it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is really all saying that there are huge challenges ahead, and I only wish that there were more people with your kind of judgment and wise counsel who were going to talk about this. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, not wise necessarily, but at least inquisitive. Yes, I’m inquisitive, and yes, am I afraid to throw ideas on the table? No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think what these interviews have demonstrated and your whole career have demonstrated is that you’ve not been afraid to state your mind clearly and openly and fight for it, and I think so many people are not really willing to do that. You’ve really been willing to be your own person throughout your career.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, it’s fun, because sooner or later you’re going to be proven right or wrong, and more often I’ve been proven right. I’ve been out on a limb for a period of time, but then it all comes full circle and you only wish that decisions had been made earlier rather than later. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Listen, what I will do now is—do consult the people, the latest bunch I’ve told you about. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I will definitely do that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think they’re really important. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’ll try to do that soon.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>What I’m going to do is in the next couple of months, I’ll be down in St. Croix where it’s warm and where I can swim and get myself back into some sort of condition, and I’m going to continue to put down some thoughts, in other words, which I’ll then get back together with you on. </p>
          <p>[Discussion of timeline for the project]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s terrific. That would be wonderful. Thank you so much for all your time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, no, thank you for what you’re doing and I want to get back together. I do. </p>
