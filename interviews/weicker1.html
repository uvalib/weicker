          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This is Phyllis Leffler speaking. The date is April 20, 2010. I’m in the Harrison Small Library and I am here to conduct an interview with Governor Lowell P. Weicker. This interview is related to the very extensive Lowell Weicker Papers Project that’s located at the University of Virginia. Good morning, Governor Weicker. Thank you for being with us and for doing this.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000110"></a>0:01:10</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s background and early interest in politics</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Good morning, Phyllis. I notice that the first question relates to the original reason for joining and working for the Republican Party and what do I think are the prerequisites for running for office. First of all, I think definitely by background I was in a Republican environment in terms of having been raised on Park Avenue in New York and on the North Shore of Long Island. My father was a Republican. My mother was not. She was a British citizen, and her leanings were toward the Democratic Party, but I always felt that whether it was her influence or my father who was a moderate Republican, not a conservative, that I carried with me—what’s the word I would use—the inclination to be a Republican.</p>
          <p>I always wanted to be in politics, literally from the time I was in grade school at the Buckley School in New York. I used to be very active in political discussions and debates, in which, I might add, I more often took the part of Franklin Roosevelt than whoever his Republican opponent happened to be. </p>
          <p>To me, a political convention—by that, I mean, presidential—was more exciting than a baseball game, so I had all the desire from earliest days to be in a lifetime of politics, and I carried that with me through prep school, where I was a member of the debating society, and again at Yale, where I was a member of the Political Union where I had debates, I might add, with William F. Buckley, among others. Politics was something I always wanted to make my life.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Can I just ask as a follow-up, as you were a young boy growing up, who were the people in political life that you most admired? You say you always wanted to be involved in politics. There must have been people who you saw as role models in some way.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, certainly Franklin Roosevelt would be number one. Also at that time, I was very admiring of Wendell Willkie, who was one of his Republican opponents. As to state and local figures, I knew them all. Being raised in New York, I was conversant with, not knowing them personally, the mayors of New York and the senators in New York State. I think that pretty well sums up the experience that I had. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You came from a family, it sounds, that was very interested in politics.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>No. That’s not true. Nobody was interested in politics, and even though my father was a moderate Republican, he had no interest in politics, not until I got into politics. And nobody I knew was really interested in politics. It wasn’t something that young men from Park Avenue, the North Shore of Long Island, got into. In any event, as I said, I had made up my mind early on that I was going to get into it.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000600"></a>0:06:00</p>
          <p class="c-header">Law school and working for a law firm</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Right after I graduated from the University of Virginia Law School, my wife and I moved out to Seattle, Washington, where I hoped to find a job with a law firm. Well, one thing I didn’t do was to look up the demographics and the economic aspects of Seattle, Washington, because if I had, I wouldn’t have gone out there to look for a job. Right at that time the Boeing Company was in an airline recession, and at that time, of course, there was no Microsoft or any of the dotcom companies or Starbucks or anybody else. It was Boeing, period. And if Boeing wasn’t hiring, nobody was hiring, so I hung around there for about six months.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What year would that be that you graduated from the Law School?</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>In 1958 I graduated from the University of Virginia. </p>
<p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you. </p>
<p> <span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>So after six months of hanging around, nothing happening, I got an offer. I had family living in Greenwich, Connecticut, and one of my aunts called and said, “Listen, I was talking to somebody at a law firm in Greenwich, and they’d be very much interested in hiring you,” so I ended up with my wife and family in Greenwich, Connecticut, and working for the law firm of Ivey, Barnum, O’Mara, &amp; Nickerson. </p>
<p>Now, Art Ivey was a very close friend of the then congressman from the 4th District of Connecticut, a man by the name of Al Morano. Morano was a very interesting sort in that he had been the administrative assistant to Clare Booth Luce, who had held that 4th congressional seat prior to Morano. In any event, Morano lost in the Democratic sweep of 1958, which meant that he had to seek the nomination again in 1960. </p>
          <p>All of the Republican congressmen were renominated, since the party felt that it wasn’t their individual failures but rather the Democratic landslide that had buried their careers. The lone exception was Al Morano. Morano had incurred the wrath of the Bush family in Greenwich, and they were bound and determined to nominate somebody other than Al Morano, at which point Art Ivey, the partner in the law firm I had joined, asked me if I would take time off of my law firm duties and work as an unpaid assistant to Morano, and I said yes. So I traveled around the 4th District of Connecticut with Morano, setting up his rallies, attending his rallies, contacting delegates, etc. In any event, along came the convention, and Morano was defeated by a state senator by the name of Abner Sibal and then went on to the primary, where he again was defeated by Sibal. So that was my introduction into Connecticut politics.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It sounds like you got some good on-the-ground training.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I got very good on-the-ground training, and one theme that you’re going to hear me repeat again and again is I know that times have changed and men and women who are millionaires can automatically jump from whatever business or profession they’re in to running for the United States Senate, or indeed, the presidency of the United States. I come from a different school. I’m a great believer in the minor league system of politics as much as I am a believer in the minor league system of baseball. You learn from the ground up.<br>
          </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001122"></a>0:11:22</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker runs for seat in Connecticut Legislature</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>In 1960, then, I sought the Republican nomination for a house seat in the Connecticut House of Representatives. Now, mind you, this was a time when one man/one vote had not been imposed by order of the Supreme Court, so that every town in the state of Connecticut—Greenwich, Connecticut; Bridgeport, Connecticut; New Haven, Connecticut; Union, Connecticut, had two representatives. In any event, I was denied the nomination in the Greenwich Republican Town Committee by the Bush people, who had known of my work with Al Morano.</p>
          <p>Comes 1962, and once again I put my name out there to be nominated for a State Rep on the Republican ticket, and this time I got the nomination of the town committee and went on to the general election. </p>
          <p>Greenwich, Connecticut, was then and still is, although not as much, a Republican town, a town of about 70,000 people. It’s a lot bigger than most people think. In any event, I went out on that first campaign and did something that I did for the rest of my political career.</p>
          <p>I love street campaigning. I got a little pocket calendar with my picture on one side and calendar on the other and handed them out at supermarkets and bowling alleys and on the main thoroughfare of Greenwich. People would ask me, “What are you campaigning for? You’re the Republican nominee. You don’t have to campaign in Greenwich, Connecticut,” and I said, “Well, it’s what I think I ought to be doing, and I want to make sure to win.” So in any event, come election night, even though I was new to the town, only really had been in town for two and half years, I ran not at the top of the ticket but I certainly ran better than many of the other local candidates, and I think I attribute it to the fact that I actually actively worked to get people’s votes. Also an important place to campaign, obviously in a place like Greenwich, Connecticut, are the commuter platforms, since Greenwich was a commuting town. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But from there, you were then drawn into running for Congress.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I went to Hartford in 1962 to serve in the State Legislature, and I was very, very lucky because I was assigned to the finance committee, and the finance committee at the state level performed the same functions as the Appropriations Committee in the United States Senate or the House. It’s without a question the most powerful committee in the body, but the reason why I was lucky was not just because it was the finance committee, but because of the head of the finance committee, a retired Army colonel by the name of Bob Cairns. Bob Cairns came from Madison, Connecticut, a Republican, and with that background, you would think conservative Republican. Not so. Conservative when it came to the numbers, a fiscal conservative, but a clear progressive on social issues, and he was my mentor in the legislature. </p>
          <p>I also managed to team up with a representative from Darien, Connecticut, Genaro Frate. Frate was of Italian background. He owned the news store in Darien. Genaro was great for me from the other point of view. Genaro brought to me the understanding of the nuts and bolts of politics. He was a man of the people in the sense that he was part of the broad middle class of Connecticut, even though he lived in Darien. He didn’t belong to the wealthier strata of that town, so it just brought an entirely different point of view. I liked him and he liked me and we used to discuss everything from A to Z on the floor of the legislature. </p>
          <p>When the Republicans controlled the house, which they did for the most part of my stay up there, he headed up the roads and bridges committee, which was a very powerful committee in terms of the money that it had at its disposal to hand out. I mention those two men because they were key, I think, in my political thinking at the outset of my career.</p>
          <p>The other man that was key at that time was the Governor, and the Governor was an Irishman by the name of John Dempsey. Dempsey was a Democrat. One of the friendliest men I’ve ever met. Big smile. Very sensitive to the needs of the middle class and the poor and the disadvantaged of Connecticut. I liked him instantly, and whereas a lot of my Republican colleagues were against him because he was a Democrat, I enjoyed working with the man, and most particularly I worked with him. </p>
          <p>There were two things that happened in my relationship with John Dempsey. Number one, I worked with him on the New Haven Railroad, which was in crisis. The New Haven Railroad was going bankrupt, and it clearly was a lifeline, certainly in the part of Connecticut that I represented, so I worked with him on the New Haven, both in terms of what we could do as a state and what we did in conjunction with New York State, which clearly had to be part of the solution to any sort of a commuter problem, both in the interstate compact and in the intrastate measures. That really took up most of my time in my first year in the Connecticut Legislature. I worked very closely with Dempsey and I got to like the man enormously.</p>
          <p>The other reason why I got to like him was that it was John Dempsey more so than any other individual in the country to bring the plight of the mentally challenged to the attention of the public. John did what Eunice Kennedy did in later years. He took an event. In Eunice’s case, she took athletics, which American people love. John took Christmas, which American people love, and had filmed the Christmas pageant at Southbury Training School, which was one of two institutions in the state of Connecticut that handled the mentally disabled. It was sort of the first Special Olympics type of event to bring the disabled smack in the face of the American people. </p>
          <p>One has to understand that in 1960, which is not all that long ago, it’s not the Middle Ages, but in the 1960s the mentally disabled were warehoused; in other words, they were gone. They were born, they were put in institutions, and forgotten. Just like Eunice brought these people out into the light of day, so John did through the Christmas pageant, which everybody loved to watch as they saw these people act out a very moving experience. Anyway, I got to like John for what he did there. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002330"></a>0:23:30</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker runs for office of first selectman and wins</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>So those are the three people that really influenced what I was doing in the legislature. 
          Now, along comes 1963, and the Republican first selectman, or what most people would recognize as mayor, came into conflict with many local constituents over the fact that he was trying to make Greenwich more like New York. It’s hard for me to verbalize this, but he just wanted to have a lot of connections with New York City and take different actions zoning-wise. In other words, which would greatly expand not the geography, because he couldn’t do that, but the activities and the living experiences of Greenwich, which still at that time was really sort of a small, rural, high-income residential area. Without going through all the reasons—it’s not really important—I was asked to run a primary against the Republican first selectman, Griff Harris. </p>
          <p>I don’t know why I took it on. I really can’t give a good reason to this day. It really made no sense. It was only bound to go ahead and rile up a lot of people, and if I lost the primary, there was no question that my political days were over. I would never get another nomination from the Republican town committee. I wasn’t going to go anywhere. Anyway, I did it, and I won that primary, beating Harris by a rather narrow margin, mainly because the wealthier elements of the town really got together on this one and backed my candidacy. Many of those elements were very conservative Republicans. </p>
          <p>I then went on, having won the primary, to win the general election, so I actually held two positions. I was still the State representative from Greenwich and was the first selectman of Greenwich, and believe me, my time was well occupied between Hartford and the town hall of Greenwich. I ran again for State representative in 1964 and ran again for first selectman in 1965, being elected both times. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So, you’re running campaigns every year?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. I was running campaigns all over the place, and again, all in the same style of very vigorous personal handshake campaigning. In 1966 the Supreme Court declared the principle of one man/one vote, and that was the end then of the Connecticut Legislature as we knew it, but what happened is they voided having an election in 1966. If you were a State representative, you remained State representative, so I actually served three terms as State representative, only being elected twice. The other by court order just went over until they had the elections in ’68 when the legislature was apportioned on the basis of population. </p>
          <p>So there was no election for me in ’66, but I remained State rep and remained first selectman, which then brings me to the first of the major political events that shaped my life. But before I go and say any more, I will go back to what I said at the beginning of the interview. I was well schooled by my experiences in the State Legislature, my experience as first selectman, and the campaigns for those positions to go into a major battle for the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think you really paint a very interesting picture here of being exposed to issues and people and styles and values that I can see resonating later on in your career.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002908"></a>0:29:08</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker runs for seat in U.S. House of Representatives</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, they do. That’s it. And the campaigning is going to resonate almost immediately for that U.S. House of Representatives slot, because what had happened was that in 1960, Sibal ran and won against Don Irwin. In 1962, Irwin beat Sibal. In 1964, Sibal beat Irwin and in 1966, Irwin beat Sibal.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s amazing.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>So I was seeking the Republican nomination to run against Don Irwin. Irwin had the experience of the House of Representatives, came from Norwalk, Connecticut. Very intelligent, an able Representative, and probably would still be there today if he hadn’t stubbed his toe on a very key issue. </p>
          <p>In 1967 then, I was asked to go ahead and have a crack at getting the Republican nomination running against Irwin. Ab Sibal wanted to run again, but he was sort of old news to the Republican Party, and I got the nomination. </p>
          <p>Now the things worth mentioning in the campaign against Irwin. I said that Irwin had stubbed his toe on a major issue. He was a big supporter of Lyndon Johnson and the war in Vietnam. Unapologetic. Foursquare behind the war. He made a mistake on an issue that the district was not behind him on. Certainly the district had its hawkish elements, but as a whole you were talking about a district that still had more Democratic voters than Republicans, and the Democrats were getting very antsy about the war. More importantly, Abe Ribicoff, who was the United States Senator, had expressed his doubts about the conflict in Vietnam.</p>
          <p>Irwin makes his second mistake. He goes out and just blasts Abe Ribicoff. Well, if there were ever a popular figure in the state of Connecticut, it was Abe Ribicoff, so to take on both the Vietnam War and be for it, and that was sort of an iffy proposition, but then go ahead and take on Ribicoff—believe me, it left a hole that a Mack truck could drive through politically. Needless to say, Ribicoff supporters, most of whom were in the 4th District centered around Westport, Connecticut— </p>
          <p>Westport’s always been a very, very liberal activist town. Ribicoff had huge support there. Paul Newman came from Westport. It has a great number of artists and literary figures there and it has a very liberal tradition. Well, that town, which normally would have been Irwin’s for the taking, just turned on him in a second as did other parts of the 4th Congressional District, and Irwin was shocked when I came out against the Vietnam War. He said, “You don’t believe that and you’re just doing this for political reasons.” Well, as the record would have it, at least as I know myself, I definitely was against it, and I think that showed up later on in my life as I opposed other conflicts that were in the same category as Vietnam. <br>
          </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003428"></a>0:34:28</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s campaign style</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>On the issue, I beat him, and then the other thing that beat him, I campaigned one-on-one. I went to every beach in the 4th Congressional District, of which there are many because it’s a shoreline district. The railroad stations. The bowling alleys. The factories. The thing that really stood out is they have a big parade once a year in Bridgeport, Connecticut, which is the biggest city in the district, called the Barnum Festival Parade, named after P.T. Barnum. </p>
          <p>We asked permission to have our car, a convertible with a banner on the side for Lowell Weicker, and they said, “Only elected officials.” I said, “Well, I’m a State rep and I’m the first selectman of Greenwich.” “No, only federal officials and the mayor and Governor, so you can’t do that,” so we were barred from being in the parade, whereupon we figured there’s more than one way to skin a cat. So I and my supporters took off down the parade route on foot, and whereas Irwin was driving by majestically standing and waving to people, we were right there on the street handing out rubber jar openers which had my name on it. It’s a circular rubber disc you can uncork a bottle or a jar with. </p>
          <p>We could see Irwin in his car. He wanted to jump out of that car because he realized we were just doing more on the sidewalks of Bridgeport than he could possibly achieve riding in the car. I mention all that because it shows to me, again, the importance in politics, and if I’m going to leave a legacy here, for other people that want to get into politics, I don’t care about television or the Web, these are added matters, but believe me, the basic element of successful politics is a one-on-one pressing the flesh, and that hasn’t changed since day one. It’s the same today and it was for me when I won that campaign against Irwin, which was a big upset, an upset for the very reasons that I’ve discussed here, the campaigning and the issue and his bad-mouthing of Abe Ribicoff. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Issues Representative Weicker focuses on in first term</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>In that first term, the issues I think that drew my attention most were transportation, as it would, coming from the 4th District. Wanting to see highway trust fund money allocated for mass transit. Also, the issue of urban renewal, which was devastating the cities of Connecticut, where all the old low-income housing was being torn down and new developments taking place, but leaving the poor people out on the street.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How were you able to work on those issues as a freshman congressman?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>The question is a good question. Not so much because you’re a freshman congressman, but you’re a freshman congressman in the minority. That makes all the difference in the world. The Democrats controlled the House, and my answer to that is one-on-one contacts with your colleagues and not just standing across the aisle and saying, “Well, you’re a Democrat, therefore you’re bad.” To me, you’re bad if there’s something bad you’re standing for. The fact that you’re a member of the other party doesn’t make you bad. So I got to be very close with many of the Democrats. </p>
          <p>Well, due to those relationships, I got an amendment on one of the bills. I can’t even remember which bill it was, in effect saying that urban renewal had to be conducted on a one-for-one basis. If you were going to tear down a house, you had to put one back, and you couldn’t just go ahead and put in green space and wealthy homes. </p>
          <p>And then the last part, and my memory’s a little hazy here, but it was very important. I opposed the President, Richard Nixon, on his desire to put in the anti-ballistic missile system, the ABM. I thought it was a huge expenditure and waste of money. So we had a real go-around on that. The record’s pretty complete because I had lots of contact with the White House people who were trying to pressure me to change my position. It’s where I became friendly with Murray Chotiner.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>In any event, he called me and tried to persuade me, but he did so in a very nice way. He didn’t do anything threatening, and that’s where we got to be friends, which again, showed up later on in my career. In any event, the fight against the administration on the military spending, still opposed to the Vietnam War, the urban renewal and transportation, were the things that I got myself occupied in.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Are these the things, then, that William Buckley took you on for?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, all right, but to digress a minute—my first debate with Buckley was when we were both members of the Yale Political Union, which was the political debating society at Yale. There were four parties: the Conservative Party, the Bull Moose Party, the Liberal Party, and the Labor Party. He was a member of the Conservative Party. I was a member of the Bull Moose Party. </p>
          <p>He and I had a rip-roaring debate when he called the head of the Labor Party in a debate that we were having on some issue a communist. And I got up and really tore after William F. Buckley. I mean, we were all sensitive, as you can well imagine in those days, of how communism had been used as a scare tactic and people’s careers had been uprooted. So I went roaring after Buckley. I know a vote was taken on some aspect of that and I won. That was my only previous experience with Buckley until later on, which we’ll get into.</p>
          <p>In any event, I was really in great shape in the polls in Connecticut for re-election in 1970, and quite frankly, I absolutely, to myself, envisaged that the House of Representatives was going to be the pinnacle of my career. I thought of nothing else and I was bound and determined to get reelected. I liked being a congressman and I liked my district. </p>
          <p>In the early winter of 1970, Tom Meskill, who was the other Republican congressman, asked me to come to his office so we could talk. Tom and I had become very close. He’d been elected to the House two years earlier than I and had done so under very adverse circumstances. He came from a very Democratic district and he was a very conservative Republican, and a very nice man. And he was widely rumored to be the successor in the Senate to Tom Dodd. </p>
          <p>Dodd had gotten himself into all sorts of problems, and everybody felt that Meskill, with his looks and his brains—he was very articulate—could win that Senate seat for the Republicans. In any event, as I say, in that early winter, I forget whether it was January or February, he asked me to come to his office. He wanted to talk, so I went to his office. He said, “Look, Lowell, I want to let you in on my political plans,” and before he could get any more words out of his mouth, I said, “Listen, Tom, I want you to know one thing. I’m going to back you a thousand percent for what you’re looking to do. I think you’re a terrific candidate and a terrific person.” </p>
          <p>He said, “What am I going to do?” I said, “You’re going to run for the Senate.” He said, “No, I’m not.” I said, “What do you mean, no, you’re not?” He said, “I’m going to run for Governor.” I said, “You’re crazy. The Democrats are putting up [Emilio] Mim Daddario,” who was the congressman from the 1st District, which is Hartford. He’s one of the niftiest—I knew Mim. I knew him because he was on the Space Committee with me in the House. That was the other issue, by the way, that I was involved with when I was a member of the House. I was on the Space Committee. </p>
          <p>I said, “He’s got a lock on being elected Governor. Why are you going to run against him when you can have the Senate seat?” He said, “I’ve got my reasons.” I think his reasons were several fold. He didn’t mention all of them at that particular moment, but number one, Mary [Meskill], his wife, didn’t like Washington. She’d prefer to be back in Connecticut. Number two, he felt that he was in fighting shape to win that governorship and thought that Mim Daddario wasn’t, and there was a lot of truth to that in the sense that if you were the Democratic candidate for Congress from the 1st District Hartford, you didn’t have to campaign. I mean, it was to the Democrats like Greenwich is to the Republicans. I don’t think there’s been a Republican congressman, certainly in my memory, from the 1st District. Oh, I think there was one, Eddie May, who was elected in the [Dwight D.] Eisenhower landslide for two years. Otherwise, it’s a solid Democratic seat. And I think he just felt that personally he could out-gun Daddario. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="004927"></a>0:49:27</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker runs for U.S. Senate seat</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Anyway, in this conversation he says, “I want you to run for the Senate.” I said, “I don’t want to run for the Senate. I’ve got a House seat I just won. I like it. My polls tell me I can be re-elected. Why do I want to go statewide,” because the state is Democratic, “and risk all of that?” He said, “Well, I think the two of us can win. I’m a conservative. You’re a moderate to liberal. I think the two of us on the same ticket will appeal across the line and we can win.” I said, “Look, Tom, again, I’ll repeat. If you want to run for Governor I’m certainly going to back you for that, but I’m going to have to think about this one. I’m not going to say yes to this proposition.” </p>
          <p>He said, “Well, you think it over,” so I left and I thought and I thought and I thought for several days, and I think I finally came down on the fact that I could certainly campaign as well as anybody in the state. Number two—why not throw the dice, in the sense that, all right, if I win, it’s a huge win, and if I lose, life goes on. I can get on with a law career and make money and get out of the public arena. It was a gamble and I was young enough and crazy enough to accept the gamble, so I went to him, and I said, “All right, I’ll do it.” </p>
          <p>I would gather Meskill had foreseen this; I hadn’t—we ended up with a Republican primary, and a moderate Republican primaried him, Wally Barnes, and a conservative Republican, John Lupton, primaried me. But we had both of our organizations working for both of us. It was a tactic that was a winning tactic, and we won that primary. It was a very hard-fought primary, but we won it. </p>
          <p>We went on to the general election, and indeed, Meskill was pitted against Daddario, but by that time, the Democrats had gotten fed up with Tom Dodd so that they nominated their own candidate, a man by the name of Joe Duffey, who represented the very left of the Democratic Party, was a huge anti-war activist, and then Tom Dodd figured, “The heck with this, I’m going to run,” and he ran as an Independent, so you had a three-way race. You had Dodd and Duffey and me.</p>
          <p>At that time, 1970, televised debates were just coming into fashion. A debate was scheduled between Duffey, Dodd, and myself toward the end of the campaign. The polls showed very much of an even split between all of us, and then the debate took place. In that debate I made the comment that it was the Duffeys of this world that produced the Dodds, alluding to the fact that Duffey was way off on the left-hand side and that drew a conservative reaction within the Democratic Party, and that was Dodd’s base of support, consciously putting myself in the middle between the ultra-liberal Duffey and the conservative Dodd. Well, shortly after the debate, the poll came out, and for the first time it showed the voters breaking, and they were breaking toward me, and it stayed that way to the end. I won by a few points over Duffey and Dodd. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>If I could just interrupt here. Throughout your career, it seems to me you have the capacity to be very direct but to also say things that have a larger meaning, so to say it’s the Duffeys of this world that create the Dodds. It in a sense frames the entire set of issues. I know at other times you’ve also had the capacity to make statements like that that are very concrete but that have within them a much larger set of issues. Do you have any sense of where that capacity comes from?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, no, because I don’t consider myself a linguist. My father was. My God, my father had a huge command of the English language, and I wish I had his command. But the ability to say in very plain English, where it can be understood on the streets, I’ve had that capacity. The one thing that’s eluded me in the last several years, as you know I’m the head of the Trust for America’s Health. We advocate for a better public health system in the United States, and I’m not talking about insurance. I’m talking about public health as used to be practiced by the Office of the Surgeon General—immunization, prenatal care, bioterrorism, obesity, smoking, public health issues. </p>
          <p>I mention this because ever since the day I became president to where you and I are talking right now, I’ve asked my staff only after asking myself every night—I’ve asked my staff, members of my Board, can somebody please reduce public health to a sentence where it is understood on the streets of America? I head up the biggest public health organization in the United States. “Well, what do you do?” Nobody knows public health. They don’t. If they know it, they know it in a pejorative way, which is that it deals with the poor couple down the street. No. [laughs] I think it deals with issues that affect the poor and the rich and the middle, all the same. </p>
          <p>I have yet to be able to reduce this thing, though, to where it’s understood. It comes right back all the time. “It’s insurance.” No, it’s not insurance. It’s an entirely different issue, and we don’t even get into it because it would absolutely overwhelm us if we did. It’s public health, and I’ve described to you the things that public health does, but to go ahead and reduce that to a clear-cut statement where they can understand it, we’ve yet to arrive at that point. Anyway, this is off the track, but it gets to the question you raised about having the ability, which I always have had, to reduce issues to fairly concise terms to where people understand what’s at stake.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think that’s really a political gift.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>If you can do it, it is. I agree. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I was wondering if some of that just came from your experience with debate as a young person.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. Oh, yes. Well, no, but I think it’s all part of coming through the minor leagues of politics. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I think that’s where it comes from. You learn very fast not just in your own experiences, but don’t forget, I’m a huge periodical reader of all points of view. I read newspapers like other people have ice cream cones. I love them and I always have had that ability to do that, and some of the ideas I get are rather pithy ideas from people that are writing about it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you also don’t seem to fear taking a strong and clear stand and you call yourself the maverick, the original, an early maverick, and others have used terms like that, too.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, John McCain’s not a maverick. He’s a Republican. He’s a conservative Republican. The press labeled him a maverick when he challenged [George W.] Bush, and it was for that reason only. Anybody who would look at his record—straight down the line conservative Republican.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I agree. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="010033"></a>1:00:33</p>
          <p class="c-header">Inspiration to speak out on issues</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>In any event, there was a thought that I just had. Oh, yes. Okay. To get to your point about being direct and rather blunt on the issues, right after I was elected to the Senate in 1970, my family and I went for our summer recess to Marion, Massachusetts, which is a beautiful town on Buzzard’s Bay in Massachusetts where my wife’s family had a home. We’d been going there for several summers, and then in the summer of ’71 we rented a house and the vacation started off very well. </p>
          <p>One day my oldest son, Scot [Weicker], said, “Dad, can I take the Boston Whaler and go out fishing in the harbor?” and I said, “Sure. I’m going over to the club to play tennis.” I was on the tennis court and I heard all these sirens. I didn’t think about them until somebody called me to the telephone. They said, “Your son has been injured in an accident out in the harbor and he’s been taken to Tobey Hospital in Wareham.” What had happened was, and we still don’t know how it happened, he’d fallen overboard and the motorboat had come around and the propeller had cleaved him in the head. We went from Tobey Hospital. He was then transferred to St. Luke’s in New Bedford. Fate was going to take a hand there. In any event, for the next couple of months life was touch and go.</p>
          <p>But during that period of time, I made up my mind that the only important thing was my son’s life, and that quite frankly I said in my prayers to the Almighty, Please save his life, and believe me, I’m going to try to do everything I can to help everybody else without fear of any consequence. So that’s where I formed the attitude that I was just going to speak out on any issue that I thought needed a voice. </p>
          <p>As fate would have it, St. Luke’s Hospital, of course, doesn’t have the same reputation as Mass General or Peter Brent Brigham or any of those hospitals, but it was during the Vietnam War and the Chief of Neurosurgery had just come back from the base hospital at Da Nang, and as you know, most of the casualties that we had over there were from landmines the soldiers stepped on and the impact zone of those were into their head. I had a surgeon for Scot that had done five hundred brain operations, whereas the average doctor in Park Avenue in New York or Beacon Hill might have two or three a year, to this guy it was like fixing a broken toe, and he saved Scot’s life. Scot was then later transferred to Mass General, but the work had been done by Dr. Gifford.</p>
          <p>But, as I say, the reason I mention it was in relation to your remark, why did I speak out, and why was I blunt and why did I take on these issues that most people don’t want to touch with a ten-foot pole? Because I don’t give a damn. I just do not give a damn if I think it’s the right thing that ought to be done. I’m going to do it and I don’t care really where the votes are. Now it happened obviously in my defeat by Joe Lieberman in 1988. The voters were very patient with me and they didn’t mind going to the line a few times, but I took them to the line too many times and that came back to bite me in the tail. Again, I have no regrets. </p>
          <p>I mean even if today I went out there and advocated no prayers in school, 90 percent of the people are going to say, “You’re wrong. We want prayers in school.” No you don’t. Why do you think we have such freedom of religion in this country? You think it’s because we have allowed religion to go ahead and be part of public education? I don’t think so. It’s because we allow everybody to do their own thing.</p>
          <p>Or the same holds true of AIDS. This was way back when, when it was a moral dilemma and these were bad people. Whether from [Ronald] Reagan’s lips or [Jesse] Helms’s lips, the average person on the street was saying the same thing. They’re saying it’s different now. Back then, bad. You do not defend homosexuals. It all comes from that experience I had where I just felt so keenly about my own child and I figured I was given power as the United States Senator to do the right thing, not to worry about where the votes are. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It does indeed. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Right up through Governor of Connecticut, and then if people don’t watch it, they don’t watch it. That’s fine. I fully subscribe to our democratic process. What pisses me off nowadays is all these people that are complaining, half of them don’t even vote, and then they worry about the consequences. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It seems like the need to be re-elected is driving so much of what people do.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, sure it is. Totally.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And apparently in your life, having the capacity of a law career to drop back on and other things you knew you could do with your time, clearly I think you came to a point where you just felt you would have alternatives if you needed to have those alternatives.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. I don’t know if I would’ve gone back to the law. Do I have enough confidence in myself? Yes, that I can do what I set out to do. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. Were there times when you spoke out that you really felt you were taking very, very serious risks? Were there moments that—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Sure. There’s no question about the prayer in school. Flag burning? No question about that. Cuba? No question about that. The bombing of Libya? No question about that. Criticisms of our invasion of our Grenada? These are all huge hot-button issues. No plus side to any of them. I’m trying to think of—income tax, obviously. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Income tax, yes. And you knew that those could really be incredibly incendiary issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Oh, yes, absolutely. Watergate—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, Watergate—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Watergate turned out all right, but if you think that a lot of people flipped me the bird on the income tax out of their cars, you should’ve seen the beginning of Watergate. My God, I couldn’t walk the streets or go anywhere without people yelling at me and flipping me the bird and calling me everything. People at that time did not confront a President of the United States. You didn’t do that in 1970 or whenever it was. They do now. They didn’t then. So, yes, Watergate’s a prime example of that, as a matter of fact. </p>
          <p>Do I think it makes you a better representative? Look, out of all of that, I’ll give you one of my phrases of trying to sum up all this big, long-winded monologue I’ve had with you on this particular aspect of it. When I give graduation speeches now to any group of students, no matter whether they’re in college or graduate school or wherever, I say. “Listen, when you go out in life, don’t be afraid to lose.” There’s your summation. “If you’re not afraid to lose, you’re the most dangerous man or woman on the field.” Right now, what do you think’s going on in Washington?  They’re all afraid to lose. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s very powerful. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>It sums it all up. </p>
          <p>[Interruption for a group of people leaving the library]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>We’ve gotten to 1970.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Of the ’70 election. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Which leaves you ’76 and then ’82 and then ’88. I can go one more election. I’ll do whatever you want.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No, go ahead. Just talk about those processes and we’ll get that on the record for today.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, obviously, the period from ’70 to ’76 is best defined by Watergate. We’re not going to go over that whole subject today.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well get back to that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Now, that brings us to the ’76 election, which was the easiest election I ever had. I notice in one of the articles you included there was Gloria Schaffer, who was the secretary of state, and I might add, when I became Governor, I included her as one of the administrators of one of my departments. Gloria was very popular, but basically whereas most Democrats were having a field day in ’76 on Watergate, I was having a field day for the opposite reason. In other words, I’d been right, so I rolled to that election. It was not stressful in any way. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="011230"></a>1:12:30</p>
          <p class="c-header">Re-election to Senate in ’82 and loss to Lieberman in ’88</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>The ’82 election was a very tough election against a man by the name of Toby Moffett who was a congressman from the 5th District. Toby was articulate. He’s smart and that was a very tough election. I’d say that was probably one of the most difficult I’ve ever had. I think we were very lucky to get through it. I think there was still enough of the Watergate aura about me in addition to the other things I’d done as a Senator, so we got through it, but it was a real fight. And then there’s ’88 and the defeat in ’88. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What can you say about the ’88 election? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes. Let’s talk about that for a minute. First of all, there’s no question about the fact I ran—by that, I mean, personally ran the —it was the weakest effort that I had made in all of my elections. That includes going all the way back through the first State representative. I felt that sense of entitlement that can get ahold of you, and it did me. I felt, <em>Look, I’ve done so many things for this state, put my neck on the line so many times. You know, I ought to be at a coronation, not an election</em>. Not a good attitude to have, I might add, [laughs] when you’re going into an election, so I put forth the least effort in that election of any election I’d ever had.</p>
          <p>Point number two—my longtime campaign manager, Tom D’Amore had problems that he had to address with his family. Some of his family was in California and he had to make trips in different places of the United States and he couldn’t run that campaign, so I lost Tom D’Amore, who was my number one guy. Jay Malcynsky was his replacement, a very good man, very able guy, but he wasn’t Tom D’Amore. </p>
          <p>Probably even more important, I lost my advertising guy, Pete McSpadden. Pete was a friend of mine from Greenwich, Connecticut. He’d become the head of Dancer, Fitzgerald, and Sample, which was one of the biggest advertising firms in New York. I don’t even know if it exists anymore, but at that time it was one of the biggest. He was terrific. He produced stuff for me the likes of which nobody ever produced, whereas when he dropped off the radar screen, I can’t even remember who we used, but the advertising was nowhere near the caliber that it had been in previous campaigns. </p>
          <p>And now we get to the issue on the Buckley side of things. Incidentally, to remember, because this would be the time to mention it, the next time Buckley and I debated was during those Watergate years. We debated at Yale. He took the part of the administration and I obviously took the other side. Needless to say, I think it wasn’t one of his great evenings and I was another burr under his saddle. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Reagan and conservative agenda</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>In any event, the conservatives had become thoroughly disgusted with my performance, and it can best be summed up, Phyllis, in that quote that they ran in Vanity Fair, whoever published the first batch of the Reagan diaries, where they quoted him one day—you’ll find it—where he’s just been informed that prayers in school had gone down and he makes a statement that it’s “that no-good, fat-head pompous Lowell Weicker.” He gets in the way—I’m paraphrasing—of everything we want. Aside from the pejorative descriptions of me, which may or may not be true, he’s right. I did get in the way of everything they wanted. And, as a matter of fact, it’s quoted that way in other articles, which I read here and it said I did. And consciously so. The whole damn safety net of the country would’ve been ripped to shreds. I know people—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In terms of money for social programs, you’re talking about.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, yes, social. How about just plain old education? Let’s take the two most obvious examples. He wanted to eliminate the Department of Education and he wanted to eliminate NIH [National Institutes of Health]. Come on. Never mind all the other programs that lie in between these two rather big issues. Anyway, I do not have a warm and fuzzy image of Ronald Reagan. Do I think he was a very good communicator? Yes. Do I think a nice man? Yes, I think he’s a nice man. But in terms of what that man tried to bring upon the American public, no way. </p>
          <p>In any event, that really pissed off conservative Republicans, and I’m not talking about fruitcakes and nutcakes. I’m just talking basically your standard conservative Republican. A lot of them were mad about, and still mad about Nixon, but add onto it blocking Reagan and that was too much to take, so clearly, the Gold Coast, which was my old congressional district of Darien, New Canaan, Greenwich, etc., just revolted. They wouldn’t go ahead and supply the votes, and that’s where Lieberman got the margin of victory. It was only 10,000, and that’s where he picked it up. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And I also read—correct me if I’m wrong on this—that Lieberman ran in part on environmental issues in which you had made such a major contribution.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>I don’t remember that part, but I can tell you what I do remember. I couldn’t believe it when he attacked me on opposing prayers in school. My God, here’s a man who’s a conservative Jew—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Orthodox Jew.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, well, whatever you call it, Orthodox Jew, and if anything, he should say, “Thank God for separation of church and state.” He’s running against me on that? I couldn’t believe it. I could not believe that. I mean, that’s where he had gotten to, and as we know now, he’ll get to wherever he wants to go depending on what he’s feeling. </p>
          <p>I’ve never seen a man as less grounded in any firm beliefs or principles than Joe Lieberman. Nobody. And it isn’t because he beat me. I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ve been a spectator the last ten years as I see him bopping around and being for a Democrat and then abandoning Gore during the recount, then getting back in and speaking at the Republican convention, going after [Barack] Obama. I mean please. And becoming Bush’s favorite Senator out there. It’s been mind-boggling. It really has. I’ve never seen such a song and dance in my life, but it worked in ’88. He ran to the right of me. </p>
          <p>Fair enough. I mean, I have no complaint. As I’ve already said, I ran a shitty campaign. I lost some of my top people. The state itself, I think, was fed up with my taking these controversial stands, so what happened, happened. Even though it was narrow, and I had a right to ask for a recount, I didn’t ask for a recount because I felt that’s the way the state feels and that’s exactly what they should have, and he’s been a popular Senator up until now. I think his approval ratings are around 30 percent in the state of Connecticut, but that’s okay. The state’s finally learned what I think a lot of us knew for quite a while. </p>
          <p>In any event, it probably was time for me to get out anyway. I had a large family and I’d remarried Claudia and so we had her family and my family. I had to make some money. I had an opportunity to do that, so everything turned out okay.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, but you get out and all these conservative Republicans, as you say, are fed up with you, but then you turn around and you run for Governor and you win.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, well, I think because the state was in such terrible shape. Somewhere in the memoirs, but just so I don’t let it get away—I think I already told you the story, but we ought to put it on your tape. It’s election night; I’ve been beaten. I concede up in—I think we were in Newington some place where the election night party was supposed to be held. We concede and we drive back down to Greenwich, and it’s about 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. </p>
          <p>We put the kids to bed and then Claudia and I and Kim Elliott and her husband are all sitting in the living room in our house on Stanwich Road in Greenwich, and nobody’s saying a word. I think there was only one light on in the room and everybody’s just sitting there with their head down. Nobody says a word, and I finally turned to Claudia to break the ice. I said, “Well, this never happened with either of my first two wives.” [laughter] And so, you know, it broke the ice and life went on from there. But I will take full responsibility for that defeat, and I probably had it coming to me. </p>
          <p>In any event, then to get very briefly to—whether or not we’re going to get to that whole phase now. Yes. We lived back in Old Town Alexandria. I was part of a very successful operation called Research America. Yes, that’s when I did Research America, after the Senate. We started it. It’s become one of the biggest organizations of its kind in Washington today, and I was being paid well and I enjoyed a startup, which we were. This was to advocate for more money going to the NIH, which I’d done as a Senator, and it was logical that I would do this after I got out. </p>
          <p>Then in the meantime, the state is spiraling into this huge deficit. It doesn’t look huge compared to today’s deficit, but it was then, and people importuned me to come back to Connecticut and be Governor. </p>
          <p>I suppose I’d have to say aside from the challenge of being Governor, I’m sure that there was that element in my own mind that I was conceited enough to want to vindicate myself again at the polls. I don’t deny that. It wasn’t certainly a rerun against Joe Lieberman, so that wasn’t the issue. It was an issue with me in the sense that I felt I’d been a valuable public servant to the state and I wanted to vindicate myself at the polls. I particularly— <br>

          <p class="timestamp"><a name="012456"></a>1:24:56</p>
          <p class="c-header">Decision to run for Governor as an Independent</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Both [John] Rowland and Bruce Morrison had called me asking me if I would give my support to their campaigns, and I particularly avoided giving an answer on that to either of them. I had not made up my mind on anything for myself, but I knew that was going to be a possibility. I wouldn’t commit to either one of them, and then after a lot of soul searching and batting around with one to the other, I made up my mind that I’d go ahead and make that run, but I have to say it was a combination of wanting to end up on a high note and also vindicate myself on the defeat in the previous election. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you did so by creating a new party, too, for that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, yes, because the Republicans weren’t going to give me the nomination, and the Democrats wouldn’t—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That was a pretty gutsy move in itself to do that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I figured it out. The interesting thing was that was the toughest decision almost, because Tom D’Amore and all those that were doing the importuning were doing so for me to run as the Republican candidate for Governor. I made that decision in New York City. Claudia and I had gone up to see a friend, and I promised Tom I’d make a decision on this certain evening. I finally turned to Claudia. I said, “Listen, Claudia. I know this sounds crazy, but I’m not getting—” </p>
          <p>Let me just say one thing. I think everybody knew it wasn’t the Democrats who had defeated me in ’88. It was the Republicans that had done that. And I said, “I don’t want to get back into a foxhole with these guys that just went ahead and ended my career. And that’s exactly what I’m asking to do. We might not even get the nomination at the convention.” They’re all entranced with Rowland, who’d been bouncing around asking for it. And then come the primary, nothing’s certain there among the Republicans. I said, “I don’t want to waste my time and money doing all that shit. Let’s just go straight to the mark here and run as an Independent.” </p>
          <p>So that was really the toughest part probably of the whole process that then ensued. It wasn’t difficult for me to campaign against both Rowland and Morrison. Well, it was difficult. It was a tough campaign, but it wasn’t as hard as the decision as to how to run. That was the critical political decision, which I think was the right decision to win that race.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you had no infrastructure or support from the state.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>None. But I was very lucky, and I’ve said to this other people when we discuss Independent candidacies. I was lucky. I had name recognition. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You sure did. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>So I didn’t have to do that. I had name recognition. Obviously, that brings pros and cons with it, but so be it. And then I had really very enthusiastic Weicker supporters out there in the field and they were dying to get out there and get petitions signed and get my name on the ballot, and we ended up with I don’t know how many hundreds of thousands of signatures, way over whatever was required, which was an important part of the campaign because, in effect, we were campaigning early. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. Well, I think we’ve sort of sketched out your career here. This might be, I think, a good point to stop.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Yes, because I’m going to lose my voice.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I can see. You’ve been talking for a quite a bit, so I’m going to pause us for right now, for today, and we’ll pick up on this at a subsequent time. Thank you for getting us started. This has been very helpful. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">L. Weicker: </span>Well, I’ll tell you what you’ve done. I want to tell you right now, this is about the most complete remembrance that I’ve had of my early career, and it brings up other things, as you can tell, as we’re going along. So I’m glad we did this because it’s the furthest back in some ways. I think this has been very, very helpful.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Thank you very much, and we will continue. We’ll get started on another occasion. </p>
