          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Today is May 17, 2011. This is Phyllis Leffler. I’m in the offices of Robert Dotchin in Washington, D.C., and we’re here to do an interview for the Lowell Weicker Oral History Project. Thank you for being here and for doing this with us.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>A pleasure.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I thought I might start out by just asking you to give us a little bit of your personal background, what brought you into the halls of Congress when you decided to do so, obviously a number of years ago now for all of us.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Now, yes. I’d be more than happy to do that. Actually, my mother was a chief clerk for the legislative management committee in the State assembly in the State of Connecticut. She worked there for 30-plus years, and during the course of her tenure, she met a young, then State representative who was trying to learn his way around. She kind of showed him a little bit of the roadmap, and that was Lowell Weicker.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And your mother’s name?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Flavia Dotchin. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Flavia. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>She was one of the gals who knew where all the bodies were buried and how the process really worked. She thought Weicker was an up-and-comer and tried to help him out. They developed a good working relationship. I always had the political bug as well. I came down and ran an intern program for the Senator during the end of my senior year at the University of Connecticut. The intern program entailed bringing high school juniors and seniors for a set program during the course of the summer. I did that and then I went back to graduate school. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000157"></a>0:01:57</p>
          <p class="c-header">Dotchin joins Weicker’s Senate staff</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Following graduate school, there was an opening on his legislative staff, and so in January of 1973 I joined the Senator’s legislative operation. He was then a freshman Senator. As you remember, in 1970, after only one term in the House of Representatives, Weicker and Tom Meskill flipped a coin, and one ran for Governor and one ran for Senate. They both won. He was then a relatively unknown moderate-to-conservative Senator from the State of Connecticut, and I joined his team two years into that tenure.</p>
          <p>That was, parenthetically, right before February of 1973 when Hugh Scott selected Weicker to be on the Watergate Committee. I think that was probably one of the more defining moments, and it jettisoned a freshman Senator, an obscure Senator, into the national limelight. I was close enough to that process to observe and learn, and that began a 16-year career with the Senator.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So, you said you were always a bit of a political junkie. Did you actually study politics in college?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Yes. I was a political science major, a double major, and did graduate work in political science as well. I think part of that was probably influenced by my mother’s relationships with the State Legislature, her long tenure there. During my college years, I did an internship in the house assembly in the State of Connecticut. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you said you joined the staff by getting involved in running an internship program?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So he actually asked you to do that for the summer before you had any direct experience?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Yes, exactly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He took a risk. [laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>It was more or less trying to herd cats, trying to make sure the kids didn’t run off the rails, and they learned a lot. We were using the Senator’s relationships and influence. We set up a fairly structured week program and we did this for about six weeks during the summer, where a different group would come in each week, and during the course of that week, Senators, congressmen, people from the administration would come in, sit down, talk to them and lecture them and get interaction from them. I learned from that experience as well. It further enhanced my desire to come back after I did graduate work at the University of Connecticut to try to hopefully get a more permanent position, which in fact did happen. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And as a young staffer, can you remember anything about the initial interview process?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>I remember it distinctly. The most interesting thing I remember about that interviewing process was that I was hoping to at least get $10,000 a year, and Lowell said no, $9,600 would be as far as we’re going to go. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>So that one I remembered. I was a known commodity to him then, so it was not so much I had to prove myself. I guess I did that during the summer before, but that’s the one that still sticks with me to this day. </p>
          <p>It was a small, lean staff, because remember, he was a freshman. He wasn’t on any major committees where he had staff. Our legislative staff was three or four people. We had to cover the waterfront, and that was the time there was no television. You didn’t even have the squawk box. So the only way you could find out what was going on in the Senate was to go up in the gallery and observe, take notes, and then when the vote took place, you would run down the stairs, stand by the elevator, and when the Senator came out, you grabbed him and you had 20 seconds to distill what the debate was about as he went into the chamber to vote. </p>
          <p>But it was also a great learning experience because you learned the Senate, its rules, its procedures. One of the great things I observed was the Rule 22 debate, and that was the debate that took place really between James Allen and Robert C. Byrd. They argued whether we should change the rules as they relate to the cloture and the filibuster. If you look back in the history, those types of debates have not taken place in quite a while. The post-cloture filibuster evolved through James Allen, who was a wily old Alabaman Senator who was steeped in the knowledge of the rules and traditions of the Senate, as was Mr. Byrd. As a young staffer observing that, you learned a lot about the Senate and how it operated.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. How did you get involved in the particular issues that became your focus?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Well, in 1973-74 when I first came in, Geoff Baker, Searle Field, and I were the entire operation. Your focus usually is dictated by the legislator’s committee assignments. At that point, I think he was on the Banking Committee and the Commerce Committee. That was where you spent your principal legislative efforts during the day. </p>
          <p>There was a big housing bill in 1974 I worked on, but what happened more than anything else is that once he was on the Watergate Committee, that became an all-consuming operation, and he enhanced his staff. He brought Bill Shure and brought Bill Wickens in to add to his legal team, investigative team. Dick McGowan was his press secretary. Dick used to cover the [John F.] Kennedy-[Lyndon B.] Johnson years for the <span class="work-title">Daily News</span>. He knew his way around and knew almost every major reporter who was covering the Watergate. As a matter of fact, Lesley Stahl was a cub reporter at the time. </p>
          <p>In any event, that team was engaged, and it consumed most of Weicker’s time and energy because it became such a monumental challenge and a constitutional crisis. So the two people left behind but close enough to observe that were myself and Geoff Baker. We had to handle his committee assignments, tell him what was going on on the floor, and that sort of thing. We made sure that his base was covered and he was fully prepared to deal with those issues as well as the all-consuming Watergate issue.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that sort of pulled you into—</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000841"></a>0:08:41</p>
          <p class="c-header">Post-Watergate reforms</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>And that pulled me in. In ’75, post-Watergate, I became legislative director. As such, I took over the entire legislative operation, and we were very much engaged in those last two years prior to his first election against Gloria Schaffer. We did a lot of what I called post-Watergate reform, including campaign finance reform. Political Action Committees were in fact a Watergate reform. </p>
          <p>The other major thing we did was try to deal with one of the big abuses that came out of Watergate: how tax return information was used. Weicker said that the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] became a lending library and became a political tool used against its enemies. Well, Weicker working with then Jerry Litton of Missouri from the House side jointly put together a major initiative. That legislation became law. It tightened up who could get access to tax return information, its terms, conditions, and so forth. That’s Section 6103 of the tax code. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>My goodness. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>I remember that because I was deeply engaged in that process, and it was a fascinating project. </p>
          <p>That was probably one of the best times for Weicker, because Jerry Ford, a very close personal friend, became President during those last two years. He put together I think one of the great Cabinets of our time. Ed Levy at the Department of Justice was terrific. Carla Hills was at the Department of HUD [Housing and Urban Development] and then Dick Cheney was Chief of Staff. [Donald] Rumsfeld, I think, was Department of Defense at the time. Ford put together a staff and a group that reflected, I think, Lowell’s view to this day of what the Republican Party should be. It was a very cooperative relationship. We worked directly with the President and got some major reforms, the Watergate reforms, done in those two years since—after the Watergate Committee ran its course. Obviously, in August of ’74, [Richard] Nixon resigned.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>When you say you worked directly with the President, can you explain what that means?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Well, there was a classic photo of Weicker sitting down with President Ford and his team as he presented what he wanted to do legislatively to tighten the IRS code as it relates to the disclosure of tax information. He laid out his ideas to the President’s team. We can propose, we can dispose, but the President’s got to sign the bill. He signed onto that process and it eventually became law. A direct personal involvement meeting with the President did take place in ’75 to get this issue on his radar screen and get him fully engaged.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Now, in terms of the Small Business Administration Committee work, Lowell Weicker joins that as a minority in the Senate.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>A quick story. It’s a fascinating story. In 1976, when Weicker was running for re-election, he was just on the Committee. Jack Javits was the ranking Republican.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And I think he says in his book that Jack Javits asked him if he would— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>And what happened was that because of internal machinations of the Senate, Javits  had to leave the Committee. Two other people that were ahead of Lowell in seniority, J. Glenn Beall and Bill Brock, both got defeated, and so lo and behold we’re preparing—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m sorry. J. who? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>J. Glenn Beall. I think he since died, and also Bill Brock of Tennessee. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Beall was from Maryland. They were both ahead of Weicker in seniority, so we were fully prepared to probably leave the Committee and move on to other committees as we looked ahead after he’d won in 1977. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001236"></a>0:12:36</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker becomes ranking Republican on Small Business Committee</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Then lo and behold, we wake up, as he calls it. Sometimes it’s like being in the military. You’ve suddenly got an assignment. You train to do X and suddenly you’re doing Y. And so he became the ranking Republican on the Small Business Committee in 1977. I was legislative director at that time. He asked me to go up there, put a staff together, and be his staff director for all the Republicans on the Committee. We put together an agenda working then with the chairman of the Committee, who was Gaylord Nelson. </p>
          <p>I decided to do that, as I thought it was a new challenge for me. So in 1977 I went up there and was fully engaged in that process until the ’80 election. Since I’d been in the Senate from ’73 to ’80, Republicans had always been in the minority. In November 1980, we woke up one day and said, “Oh, my God, we’ve got to run this place.” That was a fun challenge. </p>
          <p>In 1981 we took over the Committee and put together the entire staff, a legislative agenda, and moved forward rather vigorously. Remember, in that 1981 timeframe Weicker was bumping up to a very tough re-election in 1982 with then Congressman Toby Moffett. He had to hit the ground running. In that time period between November of that election in 1980 until January, we fully staffed. We ramped up from a staff of four or five as a minority to a staff of 25. It was an exciting time. We put together a hell of a team. We hit the ground running and we did a number of things in that first year and a half during his chairmanship prior to his election in ’82.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You’re suddenly in the majority, but you’re also battling, not maybe initially but after a little while, battling a President who doesn’t really—and particularly with small businesses.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Yes, with small business issues. Well, it was funny. When we first took over the committee, the first thing, and one of the most important things we did institutionally, was change the status of the Small Business Committee. It was a select committee. Gaylord Nelson never dealt with the issue head-on. They used to sometimes drop the “Select” off their letterhead, but in fact, it was still institutionally a select committee. By that, you mean it could be a temporary committee. There was no permanency to it. So one of the first things Weicker did working with then Majority Leader Howard Baker was to make the Small Business Committee a permanent, full standing committee in the United States Senate with a change in the Senate rules. That was done, and it was an appropriate statement to make to the small business constituency, saying, “Yes, this is an important constituency and it’s as important as Veterans Affairs and some of the other committees.” We got that change, and that was an important change, which obviously remains to this day.</p>
          <p>The ranking Democrat was Sam Nunn from Georgia, and we worked well with him. For all these Senators, the Small Business Committee was their third or fourth committee assignment. They’re on Appropriations, Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and other committees and Small Business, so we always had to be cognizant of that fact and encourage people on both sides of the aisle to become involved. Small business tends to be much more of a bipartisan issue. We encouraged them to engage on issues that they cared about. We tried to foster Senators’ interest if they were legitimate issues and encourage field hearings and the like. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001639"></a>0:16:39</p>
          <p class="c-header">Major tax bill signed into law by Reagan</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>In 1981, if you may remember, when [Ronald] Reagan came in the economy was in the doldrums, much like when [Barack] Obama came in. The big issue of the day was what to do to jumpstart the economy. Reagan came up with a major tax proposal to cut taxes. Sam Nunn and Weicker responded. We held hearings on Wall Street and around the country. The hearings laid out a legislative package. We got a lot of recommendations of what should be done for the small business sector to encourage capital formation, to reduce their cost of doing business, thereby allowing them to create jobs and begin an economic recovery. That we achieved and we introduced a major bill. Nunn and Weicker did not have jurisdiction over tax matters, but they did have a broad mandate to investigate matters of interest to small business. </p>
          <p>In 1981 the biggest issue was the economy, jobs, and taxes. Weicker and Nunn testified before the Finance Committee on their tax bill, and many of those recommendations found their way into the final bill, which Reagan signed into law in late 1981-82, so one of our first shots out of the box was that. It was a major accomplishment, one that we felt very strong and very good about, and that was achieved in part because of the staff we put together. We got somebody from Jacob Javits’s staff, an economist named Jim O’Connell, who was brilliant, who helped us put together the legislation, the hearings, and the like. It was a lot of Jim’s genius working directly with Weicker and Nunn. We were very bipartisan. That made that happen. So that was the first thing we achieved.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001830"></a>0:18:30</p>
          <p class="c-header">Small Business Innovation Research bill</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>The second major accomplishment in those first two years was that Weicker also encouraged other Senators’ involvement, partly because he was running. He got Warren Rudman engaged. Warren’s first major bill was the Small Business Innovation Research bill that was signed in June/July of 1982. It’s still going strong to this day. As a matter of fact, the Senate and the House are right now working on legislation to reauthorize the program for an additional eight years. The program requires all the agencies that have research and development budgets of over a hundred million dollars to set aside 2 percent of their budget for grants to small businesses. Small businesses would use federal funds to come up with new ideas, innovative ideas, to help move these agencies forward, consistent with their agency’s mission. It turned out to be an extremely successful program, and since 1982 billions of dollars that have been pumped out to the small business sector. I think it was really one of our stronger legacies from that particular era.</p>
          <p>Rudman took the lead. Weicker backed him up down the line. The funny story was when we had the bill signing ceremony. You know, Weicker was not the most beloved one at the Reagan White House. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>[laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>But thanks to Rudman, really it was more Rudman, it was such a major accomplishment. The White House held the bill signing ceremony. The bill signing took place in the beautiful setting of the Rose Garden. The day before the Connecticut Republican convention in the state where Prescott Bush was challenging Weicker, needless to say, the visual of Weicker standing next to President Reagan at a bill signing— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Didn’t hurt. [laughs] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Did not hurt. So it was sort of ironic. Probably they looked at it reluctantly. Since he was chairman of the committee that wrote the bill, they could not not invite him. Protocol forced them to invite Lowell, and he gladly attended. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think at another time for the ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act] he was consciously not invited. Is that right? Is that what I’m remembering? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Right. I think that’s correct. But that one they couldn’t get around. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>The first couple of years were productive, and one of the other things we really wanted to do is take on the agency. The Small Business Administration had always been sort of a backwater agency. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I was just going to— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>It had always been sort of a political dumping ground for both parties, in any administration. What we wanted to do is go in and try to change that mindset. We developed an investigative capability. We hired some strong investigative reporters. They were hired to go in and dig at the agency, find out what was working and what wasn’t, and try to come up with some programmatic changes to the programs.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You hired investigative reporters? Really?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So they became part of your staff, then?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>They’re one of the best teams. Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>They were great talents. Marc Smolonsky, who is now one of the top people over at the Department of HHS [Health and Human Services] and Steve Snider were both people who have the blend of being great writers and investigators. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They started that one— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>They were out in the private—they were reporters, but they also knew how to do fact-finding, and once you get the data, you’ve got to assemble it, put a hearing together, and of course you want to get press attention. These capabilities were very effective. I found that to be a very good source of investigative talents.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002238"></a>0:22:38</p>
          <p class="c-header">Small Business set-aside program</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So I know, talking about reporting, that a number of newspapers in the earlier years of the work of the Small Business Administration did call it a backwater, just as you just did, and also there was a lot of talk about issues of fraud and corruption in the agency. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Right, and there were. There were two programs that particularly—Warren looked at that. One was the 8(a) program, which is the Small Business Set-Aside Program for businesses that are owned by socially and economically disadvantaged businesses. That’s a reference to a section of the code that created it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. 8(a). </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Anyway, the Section 8(a) program. What you found is a lot of times there were front organizations, the businesses weren’t really run by a minority. They just had them up there, but they didn’t run the business, so you had those sorts of problems. The thing you wanted to do with the 8(a) program was to give people a chance to get some contracts on a no-bid basis with no competition. Then take that opportunity and use it as a business development tool, not one in which you created almost a welfare state situation. </p>
          <p>And what we did not see enough of is a graduation out of the program. In other words, once they stopped, after X number of years, getting these contracts, they fell off the cliff. That was not the way the program should’ve worked or was conceived. That’s why in the latter end of our career working with then-Senator [Dale] Bumpers we did the last rewrite of that program. We reformed the program in ’77 and ’78, which forced graduation and had certain goal settings. We made sure that they could only have a certain percentage of their work on a declining basis in 8(a). We would wean them off nonbid status and get them into a more competitive environment. </p>
          <p>Other reforms on more the financial side of the equation—there were problems in how we did a secondary market program where the 7(a) loan program, the largest loan program that the banks used to issue loans to small businesses that were a higher risk. Seventy to 80, maybe even 90 percent of the loans are guaranteed by the federal government. So if it goes bad, the federal government is there to back it up. The bank isn’t fully exposed. There were problems in that program that we had to clean up. From program to program we tried to peck away and make certain structural reforms. Some of those weren’t even legislative in nature. </p>
          <p>We were making major achievements, and then they had this Jim Sanders, who I thought was one of the best administrators at SBA [Small Business Administration] developed a great working relationship, especially in 1983-84. Jim was making reforms, and we were working hand in glove to get those reforms achieved. He was also changing the mindset of the agency. There was a much better esprit de corps. There was a much better sense of worth, if you will.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002604"></a>0:26:04</p>
          <p class="c-header">Fighting attempts to eliminate the Small Business Administration</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Then in 1985, Jim Sanders walked into a budget presentation with the President and Dave Stockman. This is a slash-and-burn budget across the board where he took on many of the social programs and whacked away at them. To show that he could do the same on the business side, he said, “Let’s eliminate the Small Business Administration outright, take a few of its programs, and put them over in the Department of Commerce and call it a day.” Sanders was fit to be tied. He had the rug cut out from under him. He didn’t have a chance to even argue his case to the President, and so the issue was joined. The issue was presented in 1985 to the Senate, which unfortunately changed our agenda radically. Instead of continuing in a productive way and trying to improve the agency, plus do some broad-based advocacy work, we were now engaged in a major fight. </p>
          <p>One of the biggest procurers of goods and services is the federal government. How can a small business get in there and play and get the playing field so it’s not so tilted against them? We reformed the procurement process in a number of different ways. In a number of other areas we continued to advocate on behalf of small businesses. Then this came out of the blue and it became an all-consuming fight, a fight that took a good chunk of that year to play out, including some dramatic hearings when Stockman testified before Weicker at the hearings, which had national press coverage. Lowell said, “There are many reforms that can be taken, but this agency will not be eliminated on my watch. It was a quite lively hearing that day because Stockman had all his staff people behind him, he pushed them all aside, and it became almost mano-a-mano situation where Weicker and Stockman took it on, hand-to-hand.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you won.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>We won, but it was not an easy fight. There were so many things on the table, and look what was on Weicker’s plate to protect. We totaled it up. When it was all said and done about two-and-a half to three billion dollars worth of add-ons were put back into the budget for him to get his vote. Now let’s say they didn’t need his vote. He would’ve lost the leverage and that agency may not have survived. When you look at the fights he was doing on biomedical research, on the various cuts that they were trying to take, to take on in the labor, health, his wars with the Secretary of Education Bill Bennett, all that was coming to a head in this budget fight. The Small Business Administration was part of that overall equation. </p>
          <p>Now, with our survival, we brought to the table massive cuts to the SBA program. We did some major reforms to the programs. We did savings to the programs. We just didn’t eliminate the agency, but that became the closest time that agency ever had to extinction. The Heritage Foundation and others when a new Republican administration will come in will say, “Why don’t you get rid of the Small Business Administration?” And that’s still a consistent theme. Ironically, the major 8(a) program that is now a multi-billion dollar program, has used the Obama administration a bit as a way to boost economic recovery efforts. This agency that almost bit the dust has been relied on extremely heavily by this administration.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Just listening to you talk about all of this, obviously, you still have incredible command of some of these details— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But I guess when you first got into this, would you have had any background in business yourself? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How did you learn all this? Just by doing it?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>It’s almost like you got thrown into it. He threw me up there in ten feet of water to see if I survived. Part of the genius of Weicker, and I tried to emulate that, as I always tried to hire people a lot smarter than I was. I always wanted to be challenged, so the staff that we put together was what really drove the process. We had a very strong staff of people that could command—I think I had the good political instincts. I was a good generalist. I knew enough to be dangerous. But I also knew I needed to have someone who could really go a lot deeper. I hired a great procurement expert. I hired someone who— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Who was that?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Bill Montalto was his name. He just retired after 30-plus years, but knew the intricacies of the procurement process. I also hired Kim Elliott. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, you hired Kim? Oh, interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Yes. Weicker and I hired Kim, a procurement expert, and she used to work for me in 1981. One of the first things she did was the Prompt Payment Act that tried to make sure that the government paid their bills on time. Lowell, to this day, will kid her about it saying it was my first big accomplishment, but it really wasn’t, but it’s one that always stuck with him. So we always tried to bring some very strong people around us to work not only with him, but with the entire Republican delegation and the Democratic side on the committee. </p>
          <p>The Committee was about 17 members. Senator Al D’Amato, for example, was on the Committee, and he had his set of issues. He really loved to use the Committee to go after crime issues, for example. Gaylord Nelson, when he was chairman, used the Small Business Committee to go after the drug industry. The Committee can be used as a platform to go in a variety of different directions depending upon the interest of the membership and what they wanted. That’s why I became very good at field hearings as well because there’s always a small business angle on almost anything. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="003237"></a>0:32:37</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s strategy for building his staff</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I want to go back to Lowell Weicker’s strategies for building a staff because it seems—  tell me how you would respond to this—that he was very willing to take risks in terms of hiring people who he thought were able and just throwing them into the fire, so to speak.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>I think that’s true. He wanted a young, aggressive, hungry staff. The best way I can put this—one time when he became chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the old appropriations guys, they’d had these staff people that’d been there 20 years and he became chairman of the—“Here’s your staff person.” He said, “It’s not my staff person. I’m not using him.” For one year, Weicker ignored him and he brought his own people in and collectively they bore in and got to know the agency and its budgets. He worked very closely with Fritz Hollings and they did a number of things. My point is that he’s not going to be led by the nose by staff he doesn’t know. He’s going to put his own team together and collectively they’ll learn. I think that’s his general approach and philosophy. When he has an intense interest, he’ll build on that interest, as opposed to me being a generalist. He hired Bob Wicklund because of his intense interest in the oceans. When he has a strong interest, he will build on that.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But he brought in Bob who had no understanding— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Nothing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—of the legislative processes. Zero.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>That’s where I came in. Bob was like a bull in the china closet, he’s going to go from A to B. I know you want to get there, but it’s usually going to have to take a little bit of windy road to get there. He didn’t understand the intricacies of the legislative process, and it required sort of team effort to make sure that he didn’t self-destruct or get overly frustrated. Things didn’t get done as quickly or as cleanly as he would’ve liked. Yes, you’re right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. And I remember when I did that interview very early on with Bob Wicklund, he said that when Lowell Weicker asked him to do this work, the first thing he said to him was, “Do I need to wear shoes?” [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>He was not a dresser. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He was used to being under the water.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>He used flippers. He had flippers on more than anything else, but as you know, given that subcommittee, he was able to have the leverage on NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] to make a difference and build quite a structure down in St. Croix. </p>
          <p>There is a classic story where he tangled with Mac Baldrige. When he was Secretary of Commerce, Baldrige took on Weicker and NOAA. It was a war. Two Connecticut guys going head-to-head. It got to the point where when Weicker went to mark-up, Weicker zeroed out all the Secretary’s personal accounts so Mac Baldrige couldn’t even buy a pencil. That’s when the hierarchy of the Senate and cooler heads prevailed. They found an accommodation. Mac shot across his bow and Lowell returned his volley. I think Mac realized the intensity that Weicker felt toward oceans research and NOAA, and when you look at the Commerce Department, it’s sort of an odd duck.</p>
          <p>The Commerce Department is a like a holding agency—everything from the Economic Development Agency, Minority Business Development, trade issues, export administration issues, NOAA. Most of the Commerce secretaries come in with that strong business background. They don’t know what the hell to do with this ocean program over here. It was an issue of priorities, and so they made an accommodation. It just shows you that Weicker also had not only the personal interest but the staff expertise to back up his strong desire. Weicker used his strength, his resources, and his power to achieve certain results. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. So clearly here’s a man who was willing to take risks, was willing to bring in some people who don’t have that much experience, bring in people who do have expertise but not the legislative experience, and my sense, from talking to so many of the members of the staff, is that people got along well. How was that managed, or did they not get along well at times?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Most of the time they did, because in some ways everyone had to deal with Lowell, and that was quite an experience. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It was a common challenge?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>That’s a good way to put it. We have a joke. Sometimes when you’re in the soup, you wear the brown helmet. Everyone took a turn in that experience. It was driven by a strong passion to get things done, so you didn’t want to disappoint. It is the nature of the process that there’s going to be ups and downs in any issues you’re dealing with. On the Small Business Committee issues, there were a couple of times I was not so sure we could win. There are always perilous times in this business. You live through that experience. Part of it also was he had that inner core of the senior staff that would go to the hideaway two to three nights a week.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Could you talk about that? That would really be interesting.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Well, what he would try to do—the Senate being the inefficient body that it is, there were many long nights, late nights. Weicker had a hideaway. It was S339 in the Capitol. He could move his operation to the Capitol instead of being over in the Russell Building and walking back and forth for a vote. He would inevitably rally the senior staff and everyone would start comparing notes on not only their day but generally what’s going on and see what’s focusing his attention. You really needed to know that so that you kept your world in perspective to where he is and what he’s dealing with. That process, as informal as it was, was extremely helpful. He would always go down and get his toasted cheese sandwich, cut them all up in little pieces, those were your hors oeuvres. Open up the bar, and at that point, in the ’80s, that’s when TV was going, and so you could watch what was going on and see what was happening.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The TV in the Senate itself, from the floor of the Senate?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Yes, from the floor of the Senate, so you could have a TV and watch things. Pre-’81, that wasn’t the case. But it was a chance for us to compare notes and get together and also share ideas, so that helped to create a camaraderie at the senior level. It cut down any competition because he set the priorities. Make no mistake; it wasn’t like you were vying for his attention and his time. He would clearly set where he wanted to spend his time and attention. </p>
          <p>I’ll give one story. It’s a fascinating story. It tells you how Lowell operated. After we won in 1980, the Senate won, we were trying to look ahead to ’81. One of the guys who got knocked off was Birch Bayh. Birch Bayh got knocked off by Dan Quayle, and he was chairman of the Constitutional Rights Subcommittee at the time. Weicker, knowing the Senate, said, “There’s a vacuum in the Senate on constitutional issues. Who’s going to protect the Constitution? I’m taking this one on.” And so he took on the anti-busing issue, he took on the school prayer issue against Jesse Helms. </p>
          <p>See, Jesse Helms at that point thought he had a clear run with the Reagan administration to take on these social issues using the Constitution as their vehicle. Unfortunately, they ran into Weicker as a roadblock. It was a conscious effort early on before anyone even saw it after Birch Bayh got knocked off and the Senate flipped. There was a vacuum. Weicker filled that vacuum and the Committee spent a significant amount of time and legislative effort. Steve Moore was one of his architects. He’s up in Minnesota now, if my memory serves me correctly. He worked for Senator Norm Coleman until he got defeated. </p>
          <p>Steve became a genius on the legislative procedures in the Senate because you had to be to do a filibuster like Lowell was doing. A procedural misstep could unravel your ability to stop the process and force a vote on an amendment, a vote that you didn’t want to take. Steve became an expert on that, and for several years he was Weicker’s right-hand person. He would live on the floor when Weicker and Jesse Helms went toe-to-toe, so, again—but it goes back to Weicker seeing a vacuum in the Senate and knowing full well what he thought his principles were, what his major interests were, and fully set the staff about the business of making that a priority. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Also, in terms of process, I wanted to ask you—the detailed notes that we have, the timelines refer a lot to your being admitted to the Senate floor.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Right.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I’m assuming it wasn’t so typical for staffers to be admitted to the Senate floor.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>No, it wasn’t. It’s fascinating. Obviously, when a bill like a Small Business bill was on the floor, as Committee chairman you’re managing the bill. Weicker was managing the bill, and therefore the staff of the Committee is down on the floor managing the bill with him. When I was legislative director, or other times when he was just going down to the floor to fight certain issues I would often sit in the little chair next to him. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>You can’t sit in that little chair unless you get unanimous consent to sit, and so it’s more of a Senate procedural matter that has to be done. If you get consent, you can stay through votes, so you can actually sit on the floor and watch the dynamics of a vote taking place, which is always fascinating. </p>
          <p>I remember when I was the young staffer I was talking about earlier, I’d run down the stairs and get him. I said every word meant everything. Literally, I know years later as I look at—you go down in the well and you see who’s voted where and you talk a little bit and they know what they’re going to do, but I thought every word I said was determinative of how he was going to vote. Little did I know. Until you actually sit down there, you’re more senior and you see how these votes play out. It’s more a product of who was working and on what issue at what time then. Steve Moore was given consent to get on the floor during those filibusters, for example. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="004519"></a>0:45:19</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s interactions with his staff</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In your recollection, in your experience, do you think that Lowell Weicker had a dramatically different way of working with his staff than other Senators did?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Yes, I think so. Well, some Senators are different. Every Senator’s different. Jack Javits had such a big staff, and I don’t think he knew more than four or five people. Some Senators will only deal with two staff, and everyone else does their thing. In other words, I worked through the administrative assistant or the chief of staff, the personal staff, my two people, and that’s it. Now with Weicker, if anything went squirrelly with the Small Business Committee, he only knew one phone number. That was me. To that extent, he knew where the buck stopped. He only had a few people that he called—then it’s your problem. But on the same breath, he also personally interviewed every person that was hired. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How did he do that? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Well, a lot of times he was the recruiter. You know, as he goes around the state, people are pinging on him. He would find other people that he would say, take a look at this person, so a lot of it was that. Sometimes it was political supporters who would say, “Can you give my son a job?” that type of thing. Sometimes those worked, sometimes they didn’t. He was, a lot of times, the recruiter. A lot of times reporters that covered his campaigns he hired. Fred Mann in 1975-76, a good guy for you to talk to. He was with the <span class="work-title">Philadelphia Inquirer</span> for years and now is with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>He was in Mystic, Connecticut, Fred was. He was a running a good bread bakery and was a stringer, ran through some of his campaigns. He had long hair, a bushy beard. Weicker was intrigued with the guy, and after the election, one press secretary left, and before his ’76 election, he said, “You know, this guy Mann, I was intrigued with him.” He calls him up, he hired him. That’s what happened a few other times with press secretaries. Lowell in his traveling, he always had his antenna out. </p>
          <p>Sometimes we would go out and find people, like for the Senate. When we were taking over the Senate we needed people that really knew how to run a committee, so we hired, for example, Diane Bateman, who was the chief clerk for the Senate Ag Committee for Herman Talmadge. Why? Because she knew how to get everything done, how to get the paperwork processed, how to get reimbursed, how to get the court reporters, all those things that you needed to do to run a committee I didn’t want to get engaged in. I wanted to delegate that because I had to figure out substantively what to do with this committee. I didn’t want to deal with the nuts and bolts, so we hired people like that or we went out and hired Jack Javits’ people. He was retiring at that time. He got beat by Al D’Amato, if I’m not mistaken. We went for talent, experienced people that knew the Senate and the committee process so we could hit the ground running. </p>
          <p>Other times Weicker will hire people who he’s comfortable with. Other things, people who know the state because you have that whole aspect of it. I’m more Washington based, but he had a whole field staff operation. He had a whole operation back in the state run by Hank Harper, who has since died, but he also had a field staff. He had about 10 to 12 people scattered around the state to be his eyes and ears, and they didn’t get paid much, but they were still a Senate employee, part of his team that was loyal. They would walk on hot coals for him, but could be good antennas both on a substantive level and a political level.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What happened when there were people hired who didn’t work out? Did he have the capacity to move them on?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Oh, yes. There were a lot of press secretaries. The two most difficult positions to be in were probably chief of staff and press secretary. The press secretary always had to tell him the bad news—somebody wrote a nasty article or something, that sort of thing. After a while, that became a draining process because he was controversial. There were as many good articles as bad articles. Sometimes it was a mutual parting of the ways. Sometimes he would let people go. But you also see a lot of longevity, too. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Absolutely. And a lot of loyalty. That’s so fascinating to me, how you engender that when you have so many irons in the fire, when you’re trying to do so much.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Ted Kennedy had that. There were three or four people who were with him for 25 years. A lot of people come and go. Some of it’s not—I wouldn’t say resume building—but they’re using it as a way to have an experience and move on. A good example of that is Stan Twardy. Stan we hired in ’78, ’77 to work on the Small Business Committee. When we first started, when I went up to the Committee in 1977, Stan was our first hire.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But he worked on Watergate, too, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>No? He never worked on—okay. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>No. He did not. Bill Shure, Searle Field.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, Bill Shure. And then Bill Shure left fairly early on.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Right. Bill was just on for Watergate only.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, and then went back to his law practice.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Correct. Stan was a young lawyer. I can’t remember—you’ll have to ask Stan how Lowell found him, but he was young. It was like Mr. Smith Comes to Washington, and he came in in his three-piece suit and he was all ready to go and he says, “Dotchin, you got Twardy.” I didn’t know him from Adam’s cat, and so part of what I had to do with Stan was to try to give a political education. I tried to give him a little bit more of a political polish because he had the legal polish, and that happened over some time. For example, one of the things we did is we took on the “Messiah” Small Business.</p>
          <p>Milt Stewart was nominated to be the chief counsel for advocacy, which was a newly created statutory position. Everyone loved Milt, but in his background he had some real problems. He got sanctioned by the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission], and Twardy bore in on that issue. Weicker said, “I’m going to oppose this nomination,” and so we fought it tooth and nail. We got 11 votes, but he felt we were right. That was Stan’s first indoctrination into the politics of the Senate. Near the end, he came down to his personal staff, became his very strong legal counsel doing a lot of the constitutional issues before he went back to Connecticut at the end of 1980 or so, just before the Senate flipped. He joined a law firm, and then a few years later Weicker appointed him to be U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I wonder if we could spend a little time talking about issues of party and affiliation. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="005226"></a>0:52:26</p>
          <p class="c-header">Dwindling numbers of moderate Republicans</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Because of course, Weicker was a Republican, but he always had values and issues that put him at odds with many other Republicans, and then of course later on, I know you were one of the key people who encouraged him to run as an Independent for the gubernatorial race. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Right, for the Governor’s race. Yes, it’s fascinating to look at the Senate. Part of the reason I think the Senate’s not working well now, when Weicker came to the United States Senate in the early ’70s, the Wednesday Group included 17 Republican Senators. The Wednesday Group were the moderate Republicans. If you think back—Javits, Clifford Case, Bob Stafford, Mark Hatfield, Bob Packwood, Mark Andrews, J. Glenn Beall, Chuck Percy, Mac Mathias, and others were a group of Senators who played in the middle. Weicker’s frustration with that group was that they didn’t play hardball enough like the conservatives did on certain issues. The common bond with all of them was that they were fiscally conservative, but on the social issues they were much more moderate, much more supportive on civil rights and a range of social issues. </p>
          <p>What happened is if you look at the Senate, most of those moderates got defeated by liberal Democrats. When you look over, whether it be in Connecticut, New York, or elsewhere, and so that group from 17 whittled down to today, what have you got? The two Maine Senators and a few others. You’ve got maybe a group of four or five that would be considered moderates, Scott Brown now and about three or four or five Senators.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They’re very vulnerable, aren’t they?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>And at the end of Weicker’s career, there was the Gang of Six. They tried to hang together to force the Senate more toward the center. On the flip side, back in the ’70s there were a number of southern Democrats: Sam Nunn, Howell Heflin, Lawton Chiles. They mostly got knocked off by who? Hard-line Republicans. So now everyone’s in their respective camps throwing bombs on either side, and the creative middle is a much more narrow place. </p>
          <p>In ’81, when the moral majority stepped in, it changed the nature of the debate with respect to the Republican Party. The social issues became very much paramount, and the blend with the religious overtones, especially in the school prayer debate, that sort of thing, and the abortion issue was the other one. They became litmus test issues for the Republican Party and especially for the Republican, any candidate who’s running for President of the United States. That became a very strong dividing line that began to force Weicker to take more and more vigorous stands against the party leader, the President, and made the invitations to the White House that much more rare, but stands that he felt extremely comfortable taking based on his long-held beliefs.</p>
          <p>Now, remember when Weicker came in the 1960s— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>1968. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>—he was a Goldwater Republican. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Barry Goldwater to this day wouldn’t recognize his Republican Party, and so Lowell makes the statement, “I didn’t leave the party, the party left me,” and I think there’s some element of truth to that based on northeast Republicans having a tougher time. There were times a few years ago, about four years ago, where the House of Representatives had zero Republicans from New England. The entire New England delegation had zero. Until this last election we picked up a few, but it showed you it was rapidly becoming a South and West party, and a national party cannot be a regional party, but the encouraging thing— </p>
          <p>So if the Republican Party stays on fiscal issues and stays with that, they can become a majority party, in my view. If they get diverted too much in the social issues, that’s when you start losing the swing voters, and the swing voters are all these independent voters. There’s a lot in the suburbs in some of the key swing states that are going to determine this next election. States such as Ohio, the Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and other the rust belt states. The South is a fairly solid Republican block. The willingness of the party to tolerate that type of divergence is where that lack of tolerance now is extremely troubling. Now you’re seeing that lack of tolerance to some extent with the Tea Party on the economic issues. If you’re going to cut this mega deal, it’s got to be everything on the table, and that includes taxes. The House is only one-third of the game here. </p>
          <p>We have to rewrite this tax code much like Reagan did in ’86. Everyone knows what needs to be done. Alan Simpson put it best in his own language when he was doing that [Erskine] Bowles- Simpson commission last year. Everyone knows what needs to be done. It’s just a question of whether there’s the political will to get that done.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, right. I guess what I was really asking about, though, is Lowell Weicker has a long run, when you think about it, basically in terms of both the House and the Senate from ’70 to ’88, and yet he is constantly sort of bucking his party and President, whether Nixon or Reagan, and he pulls it off.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Right. The most interesting thing is if you ask me how did he win in ’82, because of the constitutional issues I told you about. Take a look at the New York Times editorial endorsement of Weicker. If you put Moffett’s and Weicker’s positions next to each other on paper, there was not much difference. Yet Weicker stood up against the popular trends and said, “No, that’s what the Senate’s about. We are not going to take the Constitution on. We are going to think about this.” That’s what the Senate’s beauty was. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>So my point is what allowed him to— </p>
          <p>Now, in ’88, [Joseph] Lieberman ran to the right of Weicker. Lowell’s mistake, in my view, because he lost small business constituencies and others. He lost my constituency to some extent, because he went with Ted Kennedy on a major health insurance bill back in 1988. The fascinating thing is when in 1987 the Democrats took over, Kennedy was then in charge of the Labor Committee, which Weicker was a member of. He went with Kennedy time and again on every one of these major labor initiatives, which were blocked by [Orrin] Hatch when he was chairman. I could keep my small business constituency happy on these labor/health issues, the mandate issues, because they never got voted in committee. </p>
          <p>Weicker started voting on them in ’87 and ’88. He went very aggressively. He wanted Labor’s endorsement. He always had Labor’s neutrality prior to 1988. He got their endorsement, but moved sufficiently to the left; that gave an opening for Lieberman to pull from the right more of the Fairfield County crowd, a little bit the small business people, and others. Bill Buckley and others created a group called “Get Rid of Weicker.” If you look at the vote in Fairfield County between George Herbert Walker Bush and Weicker, there was polling differential. How many more votes Bush got versus Weicker in Fairfield County was the election. We lost by 10,000 votes. There was a time when you could push the envelope too much. One would argue that at least there was enough of a Republican backlash to cost Weicker the election. </p>
          <p>The fascinating thing was that unlike ’82, when he was challenged by Prescott Bush, in ’88 there was no challenge. They kind of just went through the motions. There was no enthusiasm either. Everyone just sort of wanted to [mimics someone washing their hands], which allowed Lieberman to take that disaffection that sat there, especially within in some circles within the Republican Party and nurture it to his benefit.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Which of the campaigns were you mostly involved in? All of them?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>All three, but not directly, because I was always a Senate employee, so I didn’t get off the staff and do that sort of thing, so my role in I would say ’76 as the legislative director I put in writing what he did and what he accomplished and that was about it. With all these elections, if you’re with him, he’s living and breathing it and so you’ve got a sense of it, but I was not directly involved in any of the campaigns per se.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But you were involved in the gubernatorial one?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>No, not at all. The only thing I was involved in was that we sat down— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Just in terms of convincing him to run. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>The classic story was that after—Weicker was then with the Americans for Medical Progress. This was after he got defeated in ’88. In ’89 we had a lunch in Old Town Alexandria. There were three or four of us—John Doyle, myself, and a couple of others. We were looking at the field—it was then Bruce Morrison, a relatively obscure congressman from the 3rd District, and John Rowland. Rowland was at that point a congressman, not that seasoned. There were some huge issues facing the state, fiscal issues. We said, “What the hell? Why don’t you run? Why don’t we run as an Independent and see what you can do?” And the more we talked about it, the more he liked the idea. Tom D’Amore then—that’s his genius—he got engaged, and as they say, the rest was history. I was involved in the first sort of brainstorming session, but the actual execution of the campaign—I did a fundraiser. Then I was a lobbyist here in town and I put a fundraiser together for him with a lot of his old friends.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Two hundred and fifty dollars a plate, it says in the book.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Exactly. And we had people from Tom Harkin to Jacob Javit’s wife and other people all come together. Remember, in Washington, it’s all federal-oriented. Governors are important. As a matter of fact, my wife works for the National Governors Association and has for years. I have great appreciation for Governors because there are only 50 of those and it’s a much more elite group. If you ask Lowell, he probably enjoyed those four years as Governor because he really has a mindset of an executive in some ways. He has no problem delegating and barking orders and expecting people to follow through. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I do want to ask you some general questions about what you think his greatest legacy is, but I don’t know if you have other things you want to cover.</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="010512"></a>1:05:12</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s political legacy</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>No, I think that’s a good way to end it. If you asked me Lowell’s legacy, I think if I had to say, it would be principled advocacy. Remember, at 24, 25 years old I’m sitting in the eye of the storm of Watergate. Now think about this. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Amazing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Here’s a guy, relatively unknown. Hugh Scott puts him on the committee . He’s one of the lowest ranking Republicans in the Senate, and the fascinating thing—I learned certain life lessons that sound trite, you know—follow the facts, good government is good politics, the cover-up is always worse than the crime. Get it all out and don’t try to manage this thing. Let’s get the facts out and let the chips fall where they may. </p>
          <p>Those sound like trite expressions, but you had the President of the United States and then various senior Republican Senators, until they saw the handwriting on the wall, trying to manage this crisis. Meanwhile, documents were handed to him from John Dean, his next-door neighbor, and others, which surely showed a well-documented pattern of behavior that violated fundamental laws in the Constitution. What do you do with that as a young Senator? How he handled that not only gave me great life lessons, but I think told a story about him and left an imprint on the Senate as an institution. </p>
          <p>That principled advocacy is one which directed him at all times, whether it be the constitutional issues, whether it be other issues that he takes on out of passion and care of the handicapped and his long-term vision of the challenges to the oceans. All of that—principled advocacy would be the best way I can describe it. </p>
          <p>But he also did not tilt at windmills. He was a great legislator. He knew the process. He knew when to cut deals. He knew how to get things done. A good example: Harrison Schmitt, the former astronaut, was the chairman of the Labor/HHS Appropriations Committee before Weicker took over. Harrison Schmitt couldn’t get a bill through that place to save his life. Weicker got the first Labor/HHS Appropriations bill signed into law when he took over the Committee, partly because he wanted to make that statement, partly he knew when he had to cut deals to get things done and how to move things behind the scenes. While he had principled advocacy, he also, like in the ’85 budget debate, knew that in the final analysis if he was going to get what he needed done, he had to do the best he could, in the final analysis vote for a budget he didn’t like, but it saved a lot of money for programs he cared about, so that was the commonsense side to him.</p>
          <p>He was a very strong legislator behind the scenes, especially on the Appropriations Committee he was a force, but people didn’t see that. They always remember him as the guy taking on Jesse Helms, fighting the big constitutional fights, which are highly visible fights. There is the other side to this process, which is the legislative side, where you had to try to move forward, get things done, and do it in a way that kept your principles, but know that you’ve got to take things incrementally and make sure you’re moving in the right direction. He was a genius in that regard. It’s a unique blend of the two, and as such he was a force in the Senate, especially in certain areas that knew that they couldn’t get—that you’re walking into certain—that if you do X, you’re going to generate the wrath of the senior or junior Senator.</p>
          <p>He also had great working relationships. He always had a superb working relationship with [Abraham] Ribicoff and [Christopher] Dodd. They always worked hand-in-glove on Connecticut issues, so when the submarine was threatened in Groton, there were defense issues, they would join forces and work hand-in-glove working with Ted Stevens to make sure that certain fundamental Connecticut interests were protected, so he had a unique blend of that.</p>
          <p>The other classic principled advocacy is Tom Meskill. When Tom Meskill got defeated as Governor, Weicker wanted to put him on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, which is big stuff. John Tunney then took him on and said no, he doesn’t have the proper background. The ABA [American Bar Association] said I don’t think so. Weicker not only said no. “I want a diverse life experience brought to the courts.” He took on the ABA. He took on John Tunney.</p>
          <p>One day he quietly went to John Eastland, then Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and after about three or four bourbons, they worked things out and got the bill to the floor and he advocated on behalf of Meskill. Meskill got 53 or 54 votes. He won, and if you look back on the history, he’s probably one of the best judges who’s served on that court. Again, he knew the man. He was not going to be deterred because some ABA committee gave him a poor rating or whatever. He hung to his principles, fought it tooth and nail, and won. History judged that decision extremely well, and because of that, there are still people in the Connecticut Republican Party, some of the old-liners, Tom D’Amore being one, and John Doyle, both who worked for Meskill as Governor, that never forgot what Weicker did. That’s where your loyalties come in. When Meskill was in the breach, Weicker didn’t flinch.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I like what you said about principled advocacy. I think that’s a very important concept to put on the table. In terms of very concrete accomplishments, what do you think he’ll most be remembered for? Is it the role in Watergate?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>I think in any obit, the first thing that’s going to be read is Watergate.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, because it was so public and so— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>And it was so risk taking. If he was wrong, he would’ve been a one-term footnote. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>It’s the old story: When you go after, you better kill the king. If you’re going to take him on—when you start calling for [Harry Robbins/”H.R.”] Haldeman’s and [John] Ehrlichman’s resignations, that gets pretty serious. But I think in the larger sense for people who really will remember him, I think two other big footnotes will be, one, the protecting of the Constitution and, two, the area of trying to use the government in a way to protect those who were least in a position to help themselves, especially in the area of biomedical research. </p>
          <p>I will never forget when his dearest friend Stewart McKinney died of AIDS. The disease was unheard of. We didn’t know what AIDS was. I knew Stewart very well and we saw this guy withering in front of us. We didn’t know what it was, and Weicker was just beginning to hear about AIDS from [Tony] Fauci. Weicker became a very strong advocate for funding of AIDS research very early on. That’s another good example of what I’m talking about. </p>
          <p>Or on the handicap issue. Not only being touched personally with Sonny, but as chairman, he took those issues on and was the driving force for ADA. Tom Harkin to this day will say Weicker walks on water on that, and Tom continues to fight those battles as chairman of the Health Committee now under the Appropriations Committee. Those would maybe be the other sub-footnotes to the Watergate story. </p>
          <p>There are a number of other specific legislative accomplishments, some of which I ticked off in the small business arena, some of which you could tick off in some of his other—he was very strong in the transportation area, for getting a more multimodal transportation concept, getting much more funding into rails, opening up the Highway Trust Fund to mass transit. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But not in Connecticut. [laughs]</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Because we didn’t come from a state that— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>What Obama’s doing on high-speed rail, he would say bravo to. We tried to do it 30 years ago and tried to argue it. Those were what I’d call the series of specific legislative issues that he fought, but I think the ones that I highlighted would be the three that I think will be written about.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>One last question. Do you think the term “maverick,” which is the term he uses for his own book, is—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>John McCain was a maverick, too.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And so is Sarah Palin, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Right, right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>They’re all mavericks, but the term’s now become sort of popular. So it’s being used differently now.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Exactly. I think it’s been sort of bastardized in some ways, so I think it’s lost some of its meaning from back then. I think the maverick side to this thing comes when you tell your President, “You’re wrong,” that you’re willing to stand up against the popular tide and feel comfortable doing it. That’s I think the maverick side to this thing, and McCain was a little bit that way, much more so until he started running for President, because it all goes back to what happened to the Republican Party starting in ’81, and some of the litmus tests that were created that you had to do to get to the point where you would even get by some of the early primary states. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you have a sense of what allowed Lowell Weicker to be the maverick that he was?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Well, I think the State of Connecticut allowed him to. He didn’t get that far off the electorate. Remember, it’s a very blue state. It’s a more blue state than it was then. How many people have won statewide, Republicans, and at the federal level?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>Now, again, you had John Rowland, who was Governor for a long time, but those are different dynamics than the Senate, so I think the state allowed that sort of independence, and I think it’s like anything else, you’ve got to go back every six years, and if they think you’ve misread it, if your priorities were wrong, they’ll tell you. But I think what they like more than anything else—“Nobody’s Man but Yours” was a tagline that captured him to some extent. He was going to listen to his own drummer, but hopefully not so far off that you don’t get re-elected, and obviously that was the case. </p>
          <p>I mean, he held every major office in the State of Connecticut, and doing that, you get a good sense of politics, of people, of the process, because from first selectman to State rep to congressman to Senator to Governor—especially going up to the Senate side, he had quite a bit of a legislative experience moving to the Senate, having been in the State house and the House of Representatives, so that’s why he understood the Senate and the legislative process pretty well.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What were your biggest challenges in working with him and for him?</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="011722"></a>1:17:22</p>
          <p class="c-header">Challenges of working with Weicker</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>The biggest challenge you would have would be to get him to focus on a particular issue that you wanted to and sometimes get him not to shoot from the hip as much. Sometimes he shot from the hip. A lot of times he was right, sometimes not so right. But that was his strength, and that’s the way he operated sometimes, so that’ll be the—also, let’s say I’ve got three things I’ve got to talk to him about, but timing’s everything with him. You had to get him at the right time so that he would focus and listen. His genius was a lot of times we did some hearings and he didn’t have a chance to focus on it, and at six o’clock in the morning before the hearing at ten, I’m picking him up and having breakfast, going through the hearing, what’s it all about. He’d walk into that hearing like he’d studied it for months. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Amazing. That’s really amazing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>So in that way, he was a very quick study, and that was his genius. But you had to be, especially as a Senator with that many balls juggling in the air. At the end, he was on the Energy Committee, he was on the Appropriations Committee, Small Business Committee, and he had three or four subcommittee assignments. All of that became quite a full plate to deal with. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Is there anything else you want to add?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Dotchin: </span>No. It just was a hell of a ride. He allowed people like myself that opportunity, and I think that’s why you see the loyalty. You’re grateful for that, and I think in a way you look back and you say, “Yes, we did make a difference.” And he was pretty cool yesterday, too. </p>
