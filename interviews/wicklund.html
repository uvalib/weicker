          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>My name is Phyllis Leffler and we are in the Harrison Small Library. Today is April 6, 2010, and I am here as the chief interviewer on the Lowell Weicker Oral History Project. I’m with Bob Wicklund today. So for the tape recorder can you tell us your official name? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>It’s Robert I. Wicklund. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Just as a little bit of background information, could you indicate something about what you did prior to joining the Lowell administration? </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000040"></a>0:00:40</p>
          <p class="c-header">Wicklund’s background in oceans research</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Sure. Way, way back in the early ’60s, right at 60, I was kind of knocking around. I didn’t have any formal education, so I was working for the Teamsters Union and got really tired of that and found out about a Marine lab opening up in my hometown. I went and I offered to sweep floors or whatever. And they hired me to do some menial tasks for a month. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What was that hometown? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Highlands, New Jersey. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Sandy Hook was where this marine lab was. At that time it was the Department of Interior and later became a NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] lab, when NOAA was formed in 1970. I worked there for eight years. I was taken under the wing of the director and learned how to become a scientist. Before I left there I wrote over 20 papers and so on. </p>
          <p>I took over the job of co-founder and the job of directing and operating the hydrolab in Freeport, Bahamas. The hydrolab is an underwater laboratory that people can go, scientists particularly, can go down for a week at a time. And so anyway I ran that for five years. We put people down on the bottom of the ocean for a week at a time, and they would live down there and go through a big decompression at the end for 17 hours. We possibly put over 340 people through that process, which is the most in the world, ever, and still holds. That’s where I met Lowell.</p>
          <p> <span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But let’s back up for a minute. You said you had no formal education for this except on-the-job training?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s remarkable to me that you learned as much as you did without formal degrees in this. I’m jumping forward, but I even remember from some of what I read you said that [Fidel] Castro called you “El Scientifico,” or something like that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So clearly you developed a huge amount of expertise by working there. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000247"></a>0:02:47</p>
          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s introduction to oceans research</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, well, when I started at the hydrolab, I was director of that and I ran all the science programs and so on. I did some of my own research, but mainly in support of scientific research. And that’s basically where I, as I said before, met Lowell.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>He came down, and I don’t know if you want me to go into the— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Please tell that story. He actually tells it in his book, but I think it would be great to have. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. Lowell was one of a number of congressmen that came down for special projects we had in Freeport, Bahamas, that involved this laboratory submarine. We had the Secretary of Commerce come down, Pete Peterson. We had three Members of the House of Representatives, and Lowell Weicker was the only Member of the Senate. Those that could dive we were ready to take out to show them the laboratory, and those that couldn’t we arranged to have some lessons. Lowell was one that had no diving experience. </p>
          <p>I had this young kid working for me, and he came to me this one day and said, “Hey, Bob there’s this big guy up by the pool and he’s insisting that he’s going to go out on the boat diving with us this afternoon and he hasn’t been through the diving course.” So I said, “Well just go back and tell him that he can’t go [laughing] and that’s all there is to it.” The kid said to me, “Well, I tried that, but he wants to talk to the head guy, and that’s you.” </p>
          <p>So anyway, I went up to him and he was sitting at the side of the pool with his feet in the water. I walked over to him and I said, “Sir, I’m Bob Wicklund. I understand that you want to go out diving with us, but you can’t do it,” and he turned around and looked at me. And it was at that point that I realized that I was standing and he was sitting, and I was looking straight in his eyes. And I go, “Whoa.” </p>
          <p>He was looking right through me. I could tell that he was sizing me up, and you know, “Who’s this guy telling me—” So anyway, I said, “You know, you really don’t have the experience.” And so he said, “Well, I want to go. I don’t want to be sitting here, wasting my time on the beach. I came here to learn something.” So he says, “Let’s go out.” I said, “We can’t do it, but let’s do something different. You and I can go out, just the two of us, later, but we won’t go down all the way. We’ll just go down 15 feet. The water’s very clear. You’ll be able to see what’s going on down below.” So he agreed to it. </p>
          <p>We went out, and he went in the water. He was very comfortable, and we swam around for a while and made no motion whatsoever. Finally we came up after 15 minutes or so, we came up to the surface and he starts screaming. I mean, like, “Son of a bitch, that’s the greatest thing I’ve ever seen!” He really startled me because I thought it was something wrong. You know, this is his first time diving. And he said I was thinking, Oh man, we’ve got a problem here. So anyway, we got back in the boat and he was real excited, you know. I was really impressed by how excited he was about the whole thing. And this basically was—and he’ll even say it himself—sort of the Genesis of his interest in a big way. He was always interested in the oceans, but this kind of put him over the edge, I think.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, he says that in his book. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, I guess he did. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I was looking at it again this morning, but he basically talks about the importance of the oceans and his understanding of that. He really ties that to this experience. He said he was in his forties before he came to understand the significance of the oceans and the magnificence of them. He really ties it to this first dive experience. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I know. It was pretty amazing, and I learned a lot from him how important firsthand experiences are.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He also says in his book about you, he says, “I later learned that Wicklund was one of the country’s top divers. When he came by, I sized him up quickly. An outdoors type, probably someone who didn’t have a great deal of respect for politicians. You learned to sense that.” So is that true, that at that point you wouldn’t have had respect?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, I would modify that and say it wasn’t that I didn’t have any respect for politicians. I didn’t have any understanding. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I was pretty much a babe in the woods. I didn’t know one politician from another. You ask me about legislation, I wouldn’t know a thing about it. And so to me, he was just another person. It wasn’t a lack of respect, but— </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="000748"></a>0:07:48</p>
          <p class="c-header">Wicklund joins Weicker’s staff as oceans adviser</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And was it about a year later that he asked you if you would join his staff? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. The follow-up to that dive was that he and Bill Alexander, who was the Representative from Arkansas, and the deputy director from NOAA wanted to do a three-day dive in this underwater lab. It’s called a saturation dive. And we did, four of us.  I was down with him as sort of a safety diver. And we spent three days on the bottom of the ocean. Those were the first Members of Congress, the two of them, to ever, and the only ones—Weicker’s made four now. He made three more after that later in St. Croix, and he’s the only Member of the Senate that’s ever been living underwater to this day. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s remarkable. So he came down for that saturation dive, and then what happened? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well then after that we had a contract with NOAA to do the work of science. And NOAA decides— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You said we had a contract. Who is the “we”? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, the project, the system itself, the hydrolab, and the project was the Perry Foundation. John Perry was an ex-newspaper man. He owned 35 newspapers in Florida and he sold most of those and he started a submarine company. In the meantime he built this lab that was off the coast of Florida for a little while. We tested it out. Finally built it and moved it over to the—so it was the Perry Foundation run by John Perry, and I worked for him. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. And then so how did you— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>So then, NOAA was going to fund this other program from Germany called the Helgaland up in Massachusetts. It was a big project and they only had a little bit of money, so it was either us or that project, and they figured they were supporting us for four years, so they were going to support this other project. </p>
          <p>I wrote a letter to Lowell and said, basically, “Can you save us?” He actually called me up. It was unbelievable. He called me up and said, “Listen, I don’t think I’m going to help you,” but he said, “I really decided that I’m going to get into the oceans in a big way, and I want you to come and work for me.” And it was like, aw. You know, either I thought in my mind or I believe I asked him, “Do I have to wear shoes?” [laughter] Because I hadn’t been wearing shoes very much for 45 years, you know. I guess I thought I’d try it for a year, and I moved to Washington and worked for him for seven-and-a-half years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So how old were you when you actually started that position?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>With him?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>About 40. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You were about 40. You worked in Washington for seven years, and I know you’ve written a little bit about the challenge of making that switch. Could you talk a little bit about that in terms of what you observed initially about the process of doing legislative work or the process of working with others? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, as you can imagine, coming from the beaches of the Bahamas and the ocean to Capitol Hill was more than a shock. [laughs] I was really lost. Totally lost. I didn’t have any understanding of process, I had no understanding of how things worked, and he didn’t know what to do with me, actually. So he put me over in the Government Affairs Committee because there was an opening there. He didn’t know what to do with me at first. He knew I was going to be working on ocean issues, but we didn’t get that settled up right away. I found the whole process amazing. The amount of energy was incredible. Mostly young people, lawyers, economists, and so on. I felt very much out of place being from where I came from. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did you ever consider not staying?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, any number of times. As, you know, time would go on, especially in the beginning when I didn’t feel I was accomplishing very much. I’m not a city person, so I actually moved 70 miles out of Washington just to be out in the country. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, you commuted every day?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, every day. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>70 miles. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>70 miles. It was crazy. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How? By train, by car? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Car. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>By car. My goodness.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Because when you work for Congress, you never know what time you’re going to get home. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Trains were a possibility, but usually it didn’t work very well. But as time went on I started to see particularly how much could be accomplished. I didn’t really realize in the beginning that even though you work for the Senator, you represent the Senator, you have a lot of leeway. He has to trust you to provide him with information, with direction, on legislation and so on. But you have to understand completely what his philosophy is. And during that time, that’s what I was mainly learning, which was very important.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So could you talk a little bit about the evolution of that process, just to get the dates on the table? You started in 1976.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you went until 1983. Is that right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>’82.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. I guess what I’d really like you to talk about is what the process was like of working with Lowell Weicker. Clearly, the two of you had to develop a rapport and a relationship. Did that change over time? </p>
          <p>Wicklund: Well, it changed immediately because before I came to work for him I was sort of a friend. We became friends, and it was on that level, and as soon as I moved in the office and I was in the presence of everybody else and Lowell, I realized that he was a different animal. He loomed huge at that point, and I saw that right way, that we had a different relationship, still on the friendly basis, however. I worked for him and I better make sure that I did the right thing. Friend or no friend. You had to be very careful and make sure that what you’re doing is on his behalf and on behalf of the country and everything else, but you have to be very cautious of that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, and so how did your own role change over time?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I’m sorry?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>How did your own role change over time?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>As time went on, Lowell’s seniority was increasing, so his level within the Senate was becoming more stable—well, not stable, but he was able to accomplish more. One day he came to me—this is where a big, big change had come in. He came to me—well, back it up a little bit. He was on the Commerce Committee, which is an authorizing committee that had jurisdiction over oceans, but just the authorizing level. He had the opportunity to get on Appropriations, and I had no understanding of how important being on Appropriations was. That’s where all the money is. </p>
          <p>I had a private meeting with him and I said, “Senator, please don’t get off the Commerce Committee. You’ve got to stay on. It’s really important.” And he was saying, “You just don’t know what you’re talking about.” So anyway, he did what he was going to do, and he got on the Appropriations Committee. Suddenly I realized that he had his hands on the funding for all these different agencies. Particularly, he had gotten onto the—at that time it was called the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Subcommittee of Appropriations, which had jurisdiction over NOAA, over the Marine Mammal Commission. As far as oceans are concerned that was like gold. When I got it through my thick head that this is where it’s at, that made a big change, and then I became his chief staffer specifically for ocean issues.</p>
          <p>When it came to each year doing appropriations for NOAA, I had a lot to say. I talked to NOAA and relayed a lot of information back to Lowell. It was all his decisions. I worked on all this stuff. I made a lot of recommendations and so on, but in the end it was Lowell Weicker’s decision on what was to be done. It was at that point, when he was still only ranking—no, I’m sorry. He was on the Subcommittee and then he became ranking because the Democrats—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>—change in the administration. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Then later on when [Ronald] Reagan was elected, Lowell became chairman of that Subcommittee. All-powerful, and I was right in the middle of it. And for a short period of time there, it was pretty incredible some of the things we could do. We basically saved the Sea Grant program, and that was like a $57 million a year program. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Could you explain what that program is?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. Sea Grant is a NOAA-run or funded program that has offices in 30 different coastal states. Each office gets a certain amount of money from NOAA, $57 million at a time, spread out over the 30. They give grants out for ocean research mostly to universities and so on. Basically it’s one of the big programs that universities are involved with as far as doing ocean research under NOAA funding.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you were the chief staff person on matters relating to oceans. But if I’m reading the documentation correctly, it seems that there are multiple other issues and organizations that sort of come together. So there’s the work of the Environmental Protection Agency—protection of oceans has to do not just with protections of sea life but also the spillover into issues related to oil and ultimately Commerce, etc. So could you talk a little bit about that in terms of the interactive processes and how that worked in Lowell Weicker’s office. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="001950"></a>0:19:50</p>
          <p class="c-header">Offshore drilling and the fishing industry</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. One of the big issues at the time when I was working there in 1978 was offshore drilling, as you mentioned, and the OCS, Offshore Continental Shelf Act of 1978. Lowell, I believe, was on the Energy Committee at the time. This was an authorizing committee, so it was a big bill and set a lot of rules for later on and how we deal with offshore drilling. He was a big member of that committee that got that bill through, and specifically he had a number of amendments. One was the fisherman’s contingency fund, which still exists. Every year NOAA provides money for that to provide damages to fishermen that ruined their equipment. </p>
          <p>That was a time when fishing was becoming bigger. We were transferring all the foreign fishing over to domestic fishing and our domestic fishing fleet became very, very big and very efficient. We were at a crossroads at that time for whether we protect the fisherman or protect the fish because it was getting to that point where fishing was becoming so efficient that we were starting to clean them out. The foreigners were doing it first, and then we started doing it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>But Lowell was a big advocate of the fisherman. The Fisherman Contingency Fund was one way of helping them out. They were ruining gear on stuff that was dumped overboard. A lot of the equipment that the drillers use, they just dump it overboard, and the fishermen catch their nets on them. That was one thing. The other— he’s got the only legislation that up to this point provides for diving safety, and that’s in that bill as well. Those are two things that kind of stand out in my mind, but there were a lot of other things in there, fees and all of that, that I can’t quite remember.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. But in terms of this, you might say, overlapping process of creating legislation, where one set of issues sort of competes with another, were there specific people that you remember who were particularly important that worked in comparable areas or competing areas that made your work over time either easier or more difficult? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, maybe. I think I sent you a little piece on the deep seabed mining issue. That might be one we can talk about a little bit because that involved different people. The Deep Seabed Mining bill was being run through the Commerce Committee, which was run by the Republicans at that time. I think that was during the Reagan administration. Anyway, Lowell wanted to have some protection, meaning that if there was going to be deep seabed mining, where they drag along the bottom in the Pacific to pick up these manganese nodules, that there be some area set aside called stable reference areas that would not be touched. It would be left alone so that we could use it for research and as a protected area, because even though it was in deep, deep ocean, it’s still, ecologically, a very important place in the world. </p>
          <p>He agreed that that was something we should do, so that’s something I worked on, and we had a lot of support from a number of people. The chairman of the Committee didn’t care one way or the other about it, but the Republican staff were really up in arms over it. And, you know, we were Republicans too. They used to come to me and threaten and say, “We’re going to cut this thing out because the mining industry is totally against it. I guess the lobbyists were up there in force. </p>
          <p>I talked to Weicker any number of times, and you know, the one great thing about Lowell Weicker was that if he trusted you, as they talk about it in horseback riding, he’d give you your head. In other words, you can go ahead as long as you know what you’re doing. And so I had a lot of leeway on that one. The staffers came to me one day and said they were going to cut it out, and I said, “If you do, then Lowell’s going to stop the bill completely.” And then they said, “You’re bluffing. He would never do that.” And I said, “Yes he will.” He said, “Well, we’re going to call.” I said, “Go ahead.” Lowell wasn’t even in town at the time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And you had no idea, probably— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. I was like, “Oh man, should I have done this before talking to him?” I knew that I was in the right there, but I was a little nervous about the whole thing. But I took a chance on it anyway. It was only a job, you know, and so they backed off. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. I noticed in I think both what you gave me in writing and what Weicker says in his book that Secretary James Watt was the real thorn in your side. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, yes. He was terrible. Oh, he was terrible. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, he was Secretary of the Interior, so why was he such a thorn?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Because he was a real advocate of offshore drilling. He didn’t care about research. We had a bill, the Georges Bank Protection Act, that we were pushing. Lowell wrote it, we were trying to get it through, and Watt just saw that as a way of stopping drilling. Basically what we wanted to do was—that protection act was to do research on Georges Bank, which was a big fishing area, to see what kind of a balance we could get from that research. He wouldn’t go for that at all, James Watt, and he just made all kinds of trouble for us. </p>
          <p>We got into a special meeting that Weicker invited me to come to because I had all the background information. The funny thing about it is Watt got really belligerent and nasty to me personally. Lowell just sat back and watched and I could see his smirk on his face. He thought it was pretty funny, and I so I figured, <em>Well, he’s not stopping me</em>. I had this argument with the Secretary of Interior and it didn’t do any good one way or the other. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>He wasn’t going to change his mind. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Wouldn’t offer any protection for the environment, basically. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Exactly. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="002708"></a>0:27:08</p>
          <p class="c-header">NOAA’s complex mission</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, on that matter, I actually wanted to ask a very specific question about NOAA. I’m wondering if you see any inherent conflict in NOAA’s mission. If I’m correct in how I read the documentation about NOAA’s mission, it’s both environmental protection and research as well as stimulating economic development. I know that there was some effort to get—in 1983 there was a bill proposed by Weicker to make NOAA independent of Commerce. I’m wondering if that was an issue in terms of your own work in any way, in terms of its inherent— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Absolutely. Yes, NOAA was a strange agency in a lot of ways because, as you said, it did research, it was responsible for protection, but on the other hand it was an advocate of the fishing industry, for instance, and some of these other things. They conflicted all the time, and environmentalists are never very happy with the way NOAA—the National Marine Fishing Service, which was a part of NOAA—they are constantly being bombarded by the environmentalists because the National Marine Fishing Service supposedly protects our fish stocks, but by giving in, because of politics, they’re allowing these fish stocks to be over fished. Right now our fisheries are in terrible, terrible shape, and that exists today. That whole issue is just as real today. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Really, very real— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I talked to a Congressional staffer just about two months ago, and they’re going to introduce a bill they’re getting—because they’re so disgusted with NOAA—to try to get them out of Commerce. Whether it’s going to be independent, or maybe under the Department of Interior would be better. But independent is probably the best. It’s been an issue for a long time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In his book, Weicker claims to, in his words, change the focus of NOAA while he was chair of the Small Business Committee. And so I’m wondering, was this largely his initiative? Or this was clearly after you were hired, so was that something you brought to him?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, when it comes to that, he had his own thoughts about the way NOAA was operating. And of course I assisted him in getting information to him or making advice on certain areas you can go. But one of the things he saw was that NOAA was slowly—even though there was a real push to get NOAA to be more of an ocean agency because the ocean and atmospheric—most of the big money, especially back then, was for the Weather Service, and he wanted to get that more balanced. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>To go towards oceans?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>And so that was what he was talking about. It was focusing more on ocean issues, and he did a lot by putting more money through Appropriations into ocean programs, into whaling and so on.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, ok. And for you having previously worked within NOAA, although not necessarily for them, but within NOAA, were you able to maintain your personal and professional relationships with the agency after you went to Washington, and how did that affect your role in the legislature? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh in a big way, and even more so when I got into Washington. I established a lot of friendships. We would go out drinking together with NOAA and people. And a lot of the legislation that we did and a lot of the things that I learned about was through these people that we had these backdoor meetings with that actually worked in fairly high levels of NOAA. But they were not allowed to be with me unless they had somebody to accompany them from legislative affairs in NOAA. But we were friends. Like I said, we would go out and party together and we worked together a lot. So a lot of the things that we did, we had the help of NOAA. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So that was pretty smart of the Senator to have brought you on, given the fact that you had all these contacts and relationships. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, well, my contacts were fairly good before I came, but it was after.   Because I had a feeling for NOAA and the people there. In the end a lot of people that I dealt with were sort of the middle-level bureaucrats. There were guys that ran the program and just normal people. They wanted to see things work right, politics aside.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. In your seven years there, was there a particular time that you would say was much more focused on the issues that you were brought in to deal with, or were the Senator’s interests consistent over time? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, his interests were consistent over time, but I’ll have to say that it was during that time when we were involved with the appropriations process, from—and I can’t remember exactly when he got on it—but it was sort of the last half of my time there at least that was the most productive, particularly when he became chairman. Now of course back then, which was totally different than it is now, we were able to work across the aisle very, very easily. Senator [Ernest “Fritz”] Hollings from South Carolina was the chairman of the Subcommittee that had jurisdiction over oceans, and Lowell was ranking. His staff and myself and our staff—Tim Keeney was another one that worked on these issues from Lowell’s staff, and Claudia [Weicker], she was a big staffer on that Subcommittee. So Claudia, Tim Keeney, and myself, we all worked on these things.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Were there other staffers that we ought to, that you remember or— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, Al Stayman came as a Sea Grant intern. He came right from college. Sea Grant gave his stipend to work a year with Congress. Al came over and worked with me for a year, and later took my job when I left. Al, right now, works for the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for the Democrats. He’s there and he’s still very active in all of this. And he was someone. Tim Keeney. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did Geoff Baker work with you on these issues? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Geoff was the chief of staff.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>We always worked with him, but he had so many other issues that he dealt with, you know. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Kim Elliott as well.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. I saw her name on some of the documentation. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, these were people who were right-hand people for the Senator. I was pretty lucky. I was a little different. He wanted me to stay on ocean issues, and some other environmental things as well. Other staffs, sometimes they had a dozen different issues that they had to deal with. So from my standpoint it was pretty fortunate. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And were there other congressional offices that worked closely with you on these issues?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, well, definitely Senator Hollings’ office. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>And then over on the House side at that time, it doesn’t exist anymore,  but the Merchant Marine Fisheries Committee. I worked with a lot of those people over there. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Why does that not exist anymore, do you know?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I don’t know. Congress got rid of it. That was blow, I think. On the Senate side, the Commerce Committee, we worked with them a lot, and the different Appropriations committees. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. How did your work change on the basis of who was in the presidency?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, certainly when Ronald Reagan took over there were a lot of changes. And of course, the big change for us was the fact that we were now in the majority, and Weicker became the chairman of that Subcommittee. The first order of business was that Lowell Weicker actually selected the head of NOAA for the next four years. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It might have been after your time, but I noticed in the correspondence that, is it 1985 when there’s a claim that there’s a big leadership problem in NOAA? Do you know about that? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, ’85? I’m trying to think of who was in there. Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Let me see if I can—yes. So it’s actually from you, this memorandum. Maybe I can just show it to you, to look at. It comes out of special collections. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s hard to remember isn’t it? When you look back, see your name on something? And why would your name even been on that in 1985? Since you weren’t there anymore, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>When I left Weicker’s office, he wasn’t very happy with me because his idea was that I was going to go over and maybe take on some fairly decent position with NOAA and stay on that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I see. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I had my fill of that whole thing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The administration. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, being in Washington and so on. In my mind, working for NOAA would be a real step down from where I was before with Lowell, because with Lowell we had all kinds of freedom. We had a big power base. When you work for an agency, you know, you’re many, many positions removed from the top. But I remained friends with Lowell, and he would call me once in a while and say, “We have a new administration coming in. Do you have any idea?” So we sent them John Townsend’s and Earl Conrad’s names.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I see. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>That we knew about. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you didn’t officially stay on as a consultant. You just wrote this up as a personal— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>No, no I just maintain, and I helped him find somebody like, as I said, Al Stayman, who took my job. I had to track him down. Al was on a Japanese fishing boat as an observer out in the Bering Sea, getting beat up. When I found Al— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s not very nice. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>—he said, “Oh, yes!” He was ready to go. So he came and took the job. So things like that. Then later, in 1987 I believe it was, was when I had this other project in the Bahamas on this island, and we observed the first instance of coral bleaching, which is due to warming seas. It’s very devastating to the corals, and corals are disappearing like crazy all over the world because of it. Contacted Lowell, and through his Appropriation Subcommittee he held the first hearing in 1987—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s terrific. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>—on coral bleaching. And there have been many, many hearings after that. But he had the first one. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So to go back to my question about the role of Presidents and administrations, clearly it’s true that when Reagan comes in, Republicans have responsibility for major committees or chairmanships for many committees. That gives you the option of doing more. But I also read in the documentation that the budget cuts under Reagan were pretty devastating to a lot of these programs. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Weicker actually writes about that as well, and there’s a lot of memoranda about it. So on one hand you can do more, but on the other hand, these budget cuts really must have seriously affected what could be done in terms of the issues that most interested you. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, we could. If there was a cut in budgets of an agency that we really wanted to keep viable, Lowell would put the money back in. But there is a price that you pay for that, and that is that you have to concentrate on doing that and there’s other things that you may want to—you can’t build up all the agencies. You have to be very selective because you know there’s an overall cut in the budgets and so on. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So do you feel that Weicker stayed very true to his interest in oceans and environmental issues and that’s a real consistent— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, absolutely. It didn’t matter if I was there or not. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I know that his interest just continued on, and even to this day. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, I know. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>He’s still—we just talk about it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It’s clearly an important part of his own sense of the world right now. I’m sure that he goes down to the Bahamas for this period that he’s just come back from is also a reflection of his love of the water and the oceans and protecting all that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. Another thing that happened when Reagan got in, Malcolm Baldrige took over as Secretary of Commerce. Malcolm Baldrige was from Connecticut and a friend of Weicker’s. The result was that Weicker assigned me to Malcolm Baldrige for any information that he wanted on oceans for a year. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s useful.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>And that lasted for a year until Malcolm Baldrige tried to cut some positions at NOAA and Weicker wouldn’t let him. Malcolm Baldrige was so ticked off, and that was the end— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That was the end of that relationship. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>That was their relationship. It was pretty funny. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Politics, I guess, can do that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yep. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Also, on that same issue of the effect of Presidents and their policies, I did read that in 1978, [Jimmy] Carter vetoed the legislation to establish a National Aquaculture Program. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I don’t know why he vetoed that. I don’t know why because— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think, if I’m remembering this correctly, he said there were already other organizations that were doing this work and it wasn’t necessary for—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>—for a national program, yes. Aquaculture has become big time since then. And Weicker played a big role in the early years for getting funding for aquaculture and he wrote a bill that didn’t go anywhere, but certainly raised the vision of aquaculture. And now I think 40 percent of all fish we eat is from aquaculture. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="004345"></a>0:43:45</p>
          <p class="c-header">Environmental Protection Agency and conflicts with NOAA</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Let’s shift gears a little bit. I’d like to ask you how central a role you think the Environmental Protection Agency played in the development of environmental legislation? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>They played a big role. However, I don’t remember Lowell being very active in EPA issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you know why? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, one thing, he didn’t like the EPA, and my sense is that he didn’t like it because he felt it was too bureaucratic. There were a lot of things going on. There was one incident that we heard about over and over again. It was never really verified. But apparently some of the oil industries were—do you know what drilling mud is? It’s used for lubricating drills for when they drill offshore, and the mud’s to keep algae from growing in the mud. Full of all kinds of bad stuff. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>A lot of that was being released into the ocean. So it was a big, big issue over whether that was good or bad, and apparently the oil industry was spiking some of the specimens, the tests that they were doing on the muds, and they were actually spiking them so they would come out clean. And then they caught some EPA scientists doing just the opposite. [laughs] He was adding a few bad things to it. So that whole issue really made things—I’m not sure how much that turned Lowell, but it wasn’t a very good thing.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>There are a number of examples of, it looks like, actual conflicts between the EPA and NOAA during this period of time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. I don’t remember much of that, to tell you the truth. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>When it came to regulations and so on, I didn’t retain that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. It’s hard. It’s a lot of detail in all of this, isn’t there? Let me see if I can just quickly find it in this documentation because maybe that will help spark your memory. One thing that I noticed was that in 1983 the Senate conducted a discussion concerning how EPA would spend money for its estuary program, and Weicker argued that the Senate should discuss the role of NOAA in relation to the EPA’s estuary program and that NOAA should monitor pollutant loading, etc. And that he demanded at that time that the EPA be put on notice for failing to work with NOAA. Does that remind you now?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>That was a jurisdiction issue that he was very concerned about, that EPA was really encroaching on NOAA territory. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I see. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Estuaries being one. But there was a lot of that going on, and actually I think there was some—well, it was EPA. I thought Interior was involved, but it was basically EPA claiming jurisdiction over a lot of the coastal issues, and Lowell thought that NOAA should be the one to be doing that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And then in1986 there was this issue that the use of, is it daminozides? Do you know this? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Does it say what it was for? No, I don’t remember that one. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It had to do with Uniroyal’s production of daminozide, and this has to do with fruit production in some way. You don’t remember this? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>No. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Okay. In connection with that, I gather that, again, 1986, so after you were out of the office, a letter written by Weicker asserting that the EPA had refused NOAA’s requests for assistance in conducting damage assessment. In any case, this is past your time. So it wouldn’t necessarily be something you’d remember or be involved in. </p>

          <p class="c-header">Weicker’s legacy in protection of the oceans</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Looking back from where you sit today, and knowing the issues that you were involved in, how would you assess the legacy of Weicker in terms of the larger issues of protection of the oceans? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I think he probably—he had set the stage when he was in the Senate for much of what we see today. Aside from the fact that NOAA’s got some real administrative problems, they have been advancing. Back when we were working together, NOAA’s budget was around a billion dollars. Now it’s over four billion. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>And I think Lowell had a lot to do with the direction of all of that. You know, he didn’t get all that money for them, but he set the stage.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course he brought attention to the issues.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>He brought attention to the issues and was consistent. And that’s the thing you don’t find very much in Congress. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You don’t really. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>You know, consistency. He was consistent. He kept at it and kept at it. He had other issues, like school busing.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>But he was just as or even more so. He could’ve been excited about the oceans for a couple of years and then gone on to other things, but he— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course, and he had a lot of other issues on his plate. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, tons of them. But the fact that he was so consistent, I think that had a lot to do with the way things have advanced.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Do you see anybody who has picked up that mantle?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>No. That’s the problem. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I know. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>There’s nobody—Senator Hollings stayed on for a while. He and Senator Hollings were the champions of the ocean. Senator Hollings left a few years later, and there’s been nobody that picked up on it. We had this guy, Brian Baird from the State of Washington who is showing real interest in the oceans. He just quit. He’s not going to run in the— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, given what’s happening in the U.S. Congress, you can’t blame people. It must be so frustrating to try to get anything done. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. Exactly. I know it. Everything’s black and white now. I mean, back then there were so many—Lowell was a moderate and he had all these—it didn’t matter. It was so easy for us to work together. When I worked with Senator Hollings’ staff we were both from different sides of the aisle, but it was like joined at the hip, you know, and everything worked beautifully. But now you couldn’t do that, not a chance. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>What do you remember as your biggest frustrations, aside from just having to network so much and to work with so many different people? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, it took me a long time to get over the fact that the whole time I was there I never saw anything get done and passed based just on its merit.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You said that in what you’ve written. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, and that— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So what then are the issues in terms of getting things passed? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, of course politics, and everything that is put on the table has to run through the whole gamut of congressmen and Senators that all have their own ideas, their own ideologies, and I’ve never seen—something is real simple and good for the country, and you think, “Wow, that’s going to go through just like that.” But it never, never does. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Did you see some of your proposals and ideas watered down a lot in this process?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, sure. Yes. Lots of projects that we tried to get started through the appropriations process would get watered down by the House. When they go to Congress, they get watered down, amendments like that Fisherman’s Contingency Fund  that had a lot more money attached to it and had a lot more information when Weicker wrote the amendment, but it got knocked down quite a bit. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And that’s through special interests. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. And then— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I loved your description in what you wrote about climbing out the window when lobbyists would come to see you.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>[laughs] That’s true. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That’s great. I’m sure it’s true. You wouldn’t write it if it weren’t. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh man, used to drive me crazy. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I mean, it was like—a whole bunch of them would come in, all these guys, and I’d be sitting there all by myself and thinking,<em> I’m sitting on this power base. Right?</em> And feeling like an egg sitting on the seat and these guys were going to squash me. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Would they harangue you about things, or— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, not in a nasty way, but enough to just beat you down, beat you down. After a while, you go, Oh. So my defense was just to run. Escape out the window. [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>You surely learned a lot about the democratic process. It probably is remarkable that anything gets done in government ever, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Given this process? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Exactly. But on the other hand, as I wrote as well, government in a lot of ways selects for mediocrity. Meaning not people, but just the process. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It selects?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>For mediocrity. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, for mediocrity. Okay, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Meaning that it’s not perfect and it shouldn’t be perfect, because if it was, we’d probably have a dictatorship or something else. That democracy is—that’s the way it is. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, that is it, messy. It’s a messy, messy process.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>It’s messy, yes, but it works. Somehow or another on the other end comes something worthwhile. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Most of the time. Not all the time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I wanted to ask you too, how you feel Weicker’s commitments to Connecticut affected the policymaking process with regard to marine protection?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, he hired Tim Keeney to be the head of the Environmental Protection Agency within Connecticut. Tim used to work for him in the Senate, and I kind of lost touch with how things went from that aspect, but Lowell in the later years of his four years of governorship put in a big chunk of money to the University of Connecticut. And they built—I’ve been there. I’ve seen the— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>The marine science center? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, it’s one of the big, big marine science facilities on the East Coast. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But there were specific interests he had, weren’t there, in the Long Island Sound, for example? Let’s see—I did notice, which I found really surprising, and I wonder if you have any perspective on this. Let me see if I can find exactly where that is in the documentation. [searches through papers] There was criticism of Connecticut at some point for failure to carry out toxicity tests for smaller Connecticut marinas. Would that have been during your time?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>No. That was when he was Governor. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oh, so this would have been when he was Governor, perhaps. I can’t remember. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>It doesn’t have a date on it?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>There would’ve been a date on it, but I didn’t keep track. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>There were a few things that we—of course the Long Island Sound and fishing issues in the Long Island Sound. I went up a number of times and met with fishermen because they were concerned about what the government may be doing in terms of regulations and so on, but things like that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. So you didn’t feel like in terms of this messy process of democracy and the politics of it that Connecticut got especially focused on or favored, or the Long Island Sounds issues. I know Weicker was strongly opposed, I believe that’s true, to the pipeline that was going to be coming through parts of Connecticut and all. So the question is, did he, like everyone else in Congress, feel that he had to favor Connecticut in some of these larger issues and bills?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh sure. Sure he did; every Member of Congress has responsibility to their constituents, and he wasn’t any different in that way. </p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="005740"></a>0:57:40</p>
          <p class="c-header">Wicklund and Weicker visit Fidel Castro in Cuba</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Okay. Could we talk just a little bit about your trip to Cuba? I think this is an absolutely fascinating piece of history. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. It was fantastic. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>It sounds like it was fantastic, and you wrote about it, Lowell Weicker wrote about it. Both of you seemed to have thought it was an incredible highlight. I’d like you just to tell the story, if you would, about your time there, and also perhaps to reflect on what you think was actually accomplished in terms of the goals of the trip.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>So just going back, one day Lowell Weicker came in the office and said he’s going to initiate a trip to Cuba. He’s going to the State Department to get permission. And we all went, “Oh yeah, right.” This is during the [Jimmy] Carter administration. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>We figured he had some chance, but anyway, he had had a hard time getting the okay, but he finally got it. The whole idea was to meet with the Cubans to talk about environmental fisheries issues in the Caribbean. Cuba is a big chunk of the Caribbean, and we were working in the Bahamas, we were working other places. But it was like this big blank area where nobody was really dealing with Cuba. So we thought regardless of other issues that we could at least work together on science and see if we could do exchanges from a scientific standpoint. </p>
          <p>Everything went fine, except that the group down in Miami, the Cuban American group down there at that time was pretty nasty. They really got on our case, saying we were traitors, we were Communists. They called Lowell all kinds of names and so on publicly. Anyway, we flew into Cuba on a private plane of a friend of Lowell’s, Shaw Mudge, and we were greeted by some Cuban officials, rushed right off to a hotel, which was an old American, I forget what hotel, but it was a big high-rise thing, practically empty. We each got a floor to ourselves. About an hour after we got there, we get a bang on the door, and they brought us back to the palace an hour later. We walked into the palace and there was Fidel Castro with his entourage at the end of the room. It was pretty interesting. At that point, it was like, “Wow, this is incredible.” So Lowell and Fidel— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So was it incredible just to be there? Or what was incredible was some of the exchange that took place? That made you— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Both. At first just to be there, just the whole thing. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>And then Lowell and Fidel got into their conversation. He refused to speak English, so we had interpreters. Florence, who was Lowell’s sister, was there and she— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>His sister or cousin? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, excuse me. Cousin. You’re right. And she spoke fluent Spanish, so we talked about the environment, the oceans, diving, and turtles. He was really big into turtles, so how to protect the turtles and so on, even though they serve them in all the restaurants. Anyway— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. So maybe he wanted to protect them for food purposes. [laughter] </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. So after that, the next four days, I believe it was, we got all these tours of their milk production, their fisheries, their health program, and the only thing they didn’t talk about was lung cancer. They had a big production on health, but they didn’t talk about lung cancer. Because we found out— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, they all smoke, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. We found out later when we went to a restaurant with him that after you got served your dessert, everybody got a pack of cigarettes as a part of the meal. All the Cubans lit up, and we didn’t. None of us smoked. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Not so good for saturation dives? [laughter]</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>No, not at all. But it was quite interesting. They showed how they have these small milk production facilities and special cows that they bred to produce milk in warm climates, and big fishing fleets. They have one of the biggest fishing fleets in the world, big factory ships that go all over the world. They didn’t sell or consume their own fish because they were too valuable. Lobster and conch and snapper and so on they would export to Canada, and they get a high price for that, but then they bring in these cheaper fishes from the Pacific and places for the Cuban public— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>After the fourth day, we went to the Isle of Youth, where they have these schools—each school had 600 students, some Cubans, some were from Namibia and other places in the third world that they were teaching. It was pretty interesting. We went in one class and there was a bunch of Namibian kids doing a traditional dance from their country, and all over the walls were all these Communist posters of big eagles coming down on Puerto Rico, the American eagle. [laughter] It was pretty interesting. </p>
          <p>The last day they arranged for us to go out on a dive, and we went on this fishing boat. They had it all arranged, this really nice old fishing boat, and we left early in the morning and set out offshore. Over the horizon comes this fast boat with this Cuban soldier dressed in fatigues holding onto a high-power machine gun on the bow. It made us a little nervous, because we had no idea why it was there. And then we found out later, moments later, that over the horizon comes Castro’s yacht, and he came there. </p>
          <p>He spent ten hours with us. He came on board, went out and caught some lobster for us, and he brought in his private surgeon to slice it up into these very thin slices of sushi for our snack. One of my exciting parts of that whole dive was that Lowell and I were down on the bottom, in about 40 feet of water, just underneath the boat, so we’re taking pictures. Lowell decided to leave, and I stayed down for a short time by myself. I happen to see something out the side of my eye, and here comes Castro breath-hole diving and he came right by me. I swung my camera and I got a picture of him. I got a full picture of him that we sold to <span class="work-title">People</span> magazine. But that was pretty interesting. I felt, <em>Geez, I was all alone with this guy down at 40 feet</em>. He was just probably never alone, you know, away from his bodyguards.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Amazing. This was in 1980, correct? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Because there were two trips that Lowell made. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, he made one later on. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>In ’83 as well. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. I was not on that one. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. So aside from the human interest part of it, do you feel that there were substantive discussions that took place that led anywhere in particular?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, well, what it led to was that Castro and Lowell agreed to bring, as a cooperative science program, a team of Cuban scientists to St. Croix and the Virgin Islands to dive on the hydrolab, which was the lab we had in the Bahamas that was moved to the Virgin Islands. And that all happened, and he did come down. I mean, they did come down and caused really a lot of problems with the Cuban Americans in Miami. They said they were down there, they were all spies, and they were scientists, you know. We had to battle with them quite a bit, but the scientists spent a week on the bottom of the ocean, working along with us. We had one American down there with them, and it didn’t accomplish a lot of science, a little bit, but that wasn’t the important part. The important part, we thought, was the beginning of an exchange that would lead to really, really good science, but it never went beyond that because right after that, Reagan got in, and they tightened up the rules again. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it was really politics that once again stopped it from going to the next step. Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Exactly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>That really is a shame because— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>It is, because it was a big step forward. Big step.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Well, in terms of the process of governing, or specific pieces of legislation, or your particular role, is there anything else that you think is important to say that we haven’t covered up to this point?</p>
          <p class="timestamp"><a name="010730"></a>1:07:30</p>
          <p class="c-header">Ixtoc oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, one thing that comes to mind, and I noticed that you had on your list there, is the blow-up of the Ixtoc—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, the oil spill.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Lowell became very interested in that because that was a huge problem, and that was dumping all kinds of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and onto our shores as well. And Texas was very close by. Lowell sent me down to observe because we were getting word back that they had it under control, that everything was under control, that there were no more problems. This was after a couple days. I went down and then I was able to get a flight on a Coast Guard plane, and flew over. We flew right over it and there was this oil just blasting up out of the sea, on fire, smoke. How they could even think about saying that this thing was under control was impossible. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>This would have been the Mexican government?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, this was the Mexican— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, and just for the record, that was in 1979, right?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I think so. I don’t quite remember the date. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think it’s ’79. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, I think that sounds right. So I reported back to Lowell that this is in no way under control, and I know he made a lot of noise about that, saying that we ought to really put some pressure on the Mexican government. We ought to send people down there to help them cap that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And we did, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Right, we finally, finally got it. But of course, there is a lot of rhetoric about drilling offshore is very safe. Apparently the Mexicans weren’t all that—the American system’s a lot safer, but the Mexicans’ was not at that time. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. What are your feelings about the United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>And the response of Congress to that? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, the Law of the Sea Treaty is—when I first started working there—I think that it’s been going on since like 1972 or something like that. I can’t remember exactly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, this would be the final version of the Law of the Sea Treaty issued in 1982. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Right, yes. They had those different versions. But the fact is that the United States has not signed on to it.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>And just a few issues in there are the reason they don’t. It all comes down to industry, like the mining industry. The Deep Seabed Mining bill was supposed to address that whole issue. Didn’t really. But they felt that American industry wants total access to the oceans, and they’ve lobbied for that. Certain industries, probably oil as well. So I don’t know. But that’s the only way. We keep saying and we all know that the problem with the environment is not local. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>It’s global. And you know no matter what we do in the United States, even if we really change everything around, it’s not going to solve the problem until we get everybody on board. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>For sure, for sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>And we have not shown our leadership. We should’ve been the leader in this whole thing. Our leadership is really lacking. Same with the Kyoto Accord. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. It’s the very same issue all over again. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, and to tell you the truth, I don’t know what’s going on with our present administration. We have a lot of problems with the jobs and health issues and all that, but he just opened up drilling off of Virginia. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes. I’m so glad you mentioned that. I wanted to ask you what your thoughts are.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, I’m appalled. Absolutely appalled. Right back to the days when Lowell was fighting offshore drilling, it goes way back then and we were able to keep it from happening, and now, just like that—and it’s not going to do that much good as far as— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Oil. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>—filling the coffers. It just won’t do it. What is it? Five days? It could run the whole country for five days, and maybe that’s it. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. Well, I know our present Governor of Virginia is a big fan, right? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Of course he is. Do you live in Virginia? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I do. Yes, right here in Charlottesville. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh that’s right. We’re in Virginia. I keep forgetting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I was thinking, am I still in Virginia? I think I’m in Virginia. [laughter] Yes. So you’re appalled by this because you don’t feel it will be controlled in any way. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>No, and it takes away from the promise of other alternatives. I thought we had some kind of—at least a few steps forward in getting somewhere. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So what would you think is the motivation for this right now? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, I think he wants to get the energy bill through and this is one way of getting it through. At least this is what I’ve been reading about, and it sounds plausible. It’s a simple— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, right. So we move certain steps forward and then it feels like we go backwards. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Exactly.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Clearly in the years that you were involved and Lowell Weicker was involved this seems to have been a real, consuming passion of his. I just think, for me, reading about all of the things that he was involved in related to marine life and sea life and fisheries and estuaries, and controlling the implications of oil, I think it’s very laudable.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>We talked about there not being someone to replace him, and I think that the only thing that’s going to change things is to get somebody else in there that has the same passion. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Even with all these other issues that he had to deal with the passion came out and his interest and everything else was there and it showed. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, clearly he always had some kind of interest in these issues, but from the way he tells the story, and I would say even to some degree, despite your modesty, the way you tell the story, it seems like you had a pretty major impact on that passion.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well, my impact was to support what he believed in, and the fact that I believed in the same thing helped. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Sure. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>You know, you talk about things that bugged me when I worked for Congress—one of the things was that I felt I found very few staffers that had a lot of passion for any one issue. It was all the process. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, that’s interesting. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, the process was what motivated them. It wasn’t a passion. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So was it the process of winning that motivated them?</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, the process of winning. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So it wasn’t a particular issue that they—</p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>No. I talked to a lot of these guys. Particularly the type of mind of a lawyer, for instance, an attorney, is get the job done and win it. But it doesn’t matter whether—they can go from saving the monk seal to offshore drilling all in the same breath.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I wonder if a lot of that has to do with the way in which people come into those jobs. I mean, you came into your job having a very specific expertise, and were tapped for it. Not something you sought, you didn’t move up really through the ranks. You brought your expertise in with you and that was your focus. And even you say that at the beginning Weicker didn’t know what to do with you. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Right, yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>But I think especially young people who join Congress, they’re doing it for the rush of being involved with people of power and many other reasons too, but perhaps not with a particular focal issue that really interests them. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Right. I’ve known a couple of young guys that right out of law school they came to work for Congress because they felt that it would be good for their careers. Well, it turns out that in both cases they wanted to go back to private practice and their year or two in Congress was of no help to them whatsoever. They just had to go back and learn all over. They thought that would be a big step and they’d go back with more experience, but they found out that going back, they’d have to start the bottom level. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, but they also had a lot of contacts when they went back. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Well. Yes, that’s right, exactly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>So you know it may not have helped in terms of where they joined the firm— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Right, but later on— </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, sure. And all those lobbyists that they met who had money to bring, I’m sure it helps in that sense. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. Exactly. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, I don’t have anything else very specific to ask you at this point. As I do other interviews in this project there may be some follow-up that I’ll want to do, and I hope you’ll be open to that. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes, oh yes. I’d love to. One thing I have to say is, based on my background, the fact that I didn’t have any formal education and I did fairly well in marine science with this lab—but then when I met Lowell, and he hired me and I got that experience in D.C., that experience has been the underpinning of my career ever since. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I can imagine. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I started this project down on a small island in the Bahamas. This was after I left Weicker’s office. I started it down there and I got a big, big program. Marine science, we had ships and submarines and everything else, and the reason that it worked is because I knew how to find funding.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Of course. Yes. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>I know what to do.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Well, it sounds like you have had really a fascinating set of life experiences that are remarkably different and all incredibly meaningful. I mean, how many people can say that in the course of their lives? </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Yes. Well, it’s been fun. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Yes, I’ll bet. So anyway, I really want to thank you very much for doing this. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Oh, you’re welcome. I hope it’s helpful.</p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>I think getting the different perspectives of different people who worked with Lowell Weicker on a variety of issues ultimately will add enormously to this project. And, as I said, it may be necessary for us to figure out some time later on when we might be able to meet again. I’ll be happy to make the trip to you, if that’s easier for you. But as we hear from others, there may be things that I’d like to pick up that others are saying about other issues. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Sure. Yes, call me anytime or email me anytime. I’m usually in my office all the time. Pretty much. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewer">Leffler: </span>Right, okay. Thank you very much. </p>
          <p><span class="interviewee">R. Wicklund: </span>Okay. You’re welcome.</p>
